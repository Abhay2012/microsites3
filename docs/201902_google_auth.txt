 decoded = JWT.decode id_token, nil, false

-=----- What to do?

* auth on the frontend, keep the token
* auth on the backend every time with jwt, I guess
* write specs for everything

* now that I have the identity, display my own name in the sidebar
* create a simple view of pics, for myself only (for Klau, really)
* write the spec for it
