How to converge on a proper sleep cycle,"","<p>- Use melatonin. I started with one pill per day, now I'm at two. It works pretty well, I fall asleep easily. I also use ear plugs when sleeping.<br />- determine how much you have to sleep - it could be over 8 hours, it could be 9 hours daily - and sleep exactly that amount<br />- schedule things for early morning<br />- remove unnecessary distractions. This includes things like imgur, facebook, anything that you do not think of as competitive. This will have the effect of improving your waking life, but the side effect is that structuring your waking life will improve your sleep, as well.<br />- Get tired during the day! ;-) Physical exercise makes you good tired and looking forward to healthy night sleep.</p>",2016-02-09 21:28:14 UTC
Male to Female Ratio in All Cities,Considering moving to a different city or state? Looking to inquire upon the dating scene? Looking to find out the male to female ratio in any city? Then this advice is for you!,"<p>I juuust found this interesting resource, which looks accurate: http://maletofemaleratio.com .</p>
<p>I was looking into this question (hey, I'm nearing 30. I'm growing old. I'm allowed to be concerned). I knew that California has it pretty badly: all the engineers swarm into the San Francisco Bay Area, so it's all guys and not enough girls. At least, that's how it feels. From this point of view, Los Angeles should be better because all the actresses swarm in, and it's all girls and not so much guys, riiight? So let's verify.</p>
<p>San Jose http://www.maletofemaleratio.com/wiki/california-CA/San_Jose.htm</p>
<ul>
<li>The male to female ratio is 100:97, and the female to male ratio is 103:100.</li>
<li>The male population is 472,494, and the female population is 457,699.</li>
<li>There are 14,795 more males than females in San Jose; in percentage terms, there are 3.13% more males than females.</li>
<li>The median male age is 33.18 years, and the median female age is 34.69 years.</li>
<li>The average household income in San Jose is $71,404, and the average house value is $422,282.</li>

</ul>
<p>Los Angeles http://www.maletofemaleratio.com/wiki/california-CA/los_angeles.htm</p>
<ul>
<li>The male to female ratio is 100:101, and the female to male ratio is 99:100.</li>
<li>The male population is 1,173,364, and the female population is 1,182,630.</li>
<li>There are 9,266 more females than males in Los Angeles; in percentage terms, there are .78% more females than males.</li>
<li>The median male age is 31.77 years, and the median female age is 33.46 years.</li>
<li>The average household income in Los Angeles is $33,790, and the average house value is $289,380.</li>
<li><em>Source: U.S. Census Bureau Data</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Indeed! LA has more girls than guys, probably for the reason I stated above. And, you can look up any other city for this information. Additionally, you may mine this data yourself from the U.S. Census Bureau Data.</p>",2015-10-06 20:09:32 UTC
Beginner/Intermediate studio setup and camera setup (my personal preference),"Theory of Photography. I'd like to take a moment today to give out a brief list of items on which you can spend your money, to have a minimal studio, and a camera setup (my personal, biased preference) with which you can take on quite a number of photography tasks and subjects.","<p>What I have not looked much into is portable strobe lighting (what people would call `flash`). It is non-trivial, and immensely useful, to be able to use flash to photograph subjects such as people - and not have to carry a whole studio with you. So, other people will give you better advice than I can, on how to do this. I historically shoot mostly without flash, so I do my hardware selection based on this preference.<br /><br />I also have a strong preference to rangefinders over SLRs (single lens reflect, a type of camera. The digital SLRs are called DSLRs). With that in mind... here is my camera setup:<br /><br />X-E1 with 18mm lens.</p>
<p><img style=""border: 1px solid black;"" src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ISh-development/photos/large/524251ca533e8cdeac00000b/xe1.jpg?1380078019"" alt="""" width=""528"" height=""352"" /></p>
<p><br /><br />Purchased separately in 2013 (from Ebay or Amazon), they will run you up about $1700 including tax. I strongly recommend purchasing warranty also (from square trade), to give you a peace of mind. You don't want to be running around with a hugely expensive camera and worry about it all the time. Worry about the quality of your pictures instead! Be free!<br /><br />It may not look so, but a prime fast wide lens is the single most useful lens you can have. Prime means, no zoom. Fast means, large aperture opening (f/2 on this 18mm), which means you can shoot in the dark with no flash. And a rangefinder as opposed to a DSLR means that the cameara is light and compact - with still all the professional features that you expect from a DSLR. In fact, the designers at Fuji have done a great job in terms of usability, so I am happy to say that the X-E1 is well-designed! It gives you a variety of color options (film simulation), three different aspect ratios (try shooting square aspect ratio - it's great for portraits), full HD video, old-school controls that are fast and intuitive to use, 6 frames per second continuous shooting...<br /><br />The only disadvantage to the camera that I can think of is, it focuses rather poorly. And it is not designed to be manually focused (although you can, it is not the simplest/fastest thing in the world). So you will have to always be mindful of your focusing, while shooting. I find this to be an acceptable trade-off for the camera. I love the small size of X-E1, and I am careful about focus so I'm okay with the slow-inaccurate autofocus, I know how to use it.<br /><br />That's it! On to basic lighting equipment. I wrote in the title basic / intermediate, and that is correct. A photographer who knows what he is doing will take advantage of the same setup as the beginner setup, and have great success with it. So let's get to it.<br /><br />The single most important piece of lighting equipment you can get is a 5-in-1 reflector. I got me something like this: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Fotodiox-Premium-Grade-Professional-Collapsible-Reflector/dp/B003Y2KC7W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380078397&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=5+in+1+reflector"">http://www.amazon.com/Fotodiox-Premium-Grade-Professional-Collapsible-Reflector/dp/B003Y2KC7W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380078397&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=5+in+1+reflector</a></p>
<p><img src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ISh-development/photos/large/52425371533e8c5d58000006/reflector.jpg?1380078444"" alt="""" width=""524"" height=""560"" /><br />You will need an assistant to use it, but it is great. It is mobile, requires no batteries, and it can either remove shadow, add shadow, remove highlight, or add highlight - a very versatile thing when shooting portraits, even on the go!<br /><br />Next, you need a backdrop. The backdrop itself, and a stand for it. In 2013, that may run you up about $80.</p>
<p><img src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ISh-development/photos/large/52425464533e8c5d58000008/backdrop.jpg?1380078686"" alt="""" width=""400"" height=""400"" /></p>
<p>Next, you will need strobe lights! That's about $300 and well worth it if you are going to be doing portraits. A 750W setup is good enough: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Photographic-Studio-Strobe-Flash/dp/B003LYURRI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380079158&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=strobe+lights+750w+photography"">http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Photographic-Studio-Strobe-Flash/dp/B003LYURRI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1380079158&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=strobe+lights+750w+photography</a> You need three lights really: one primary for the face, one modifying for the face (to make the shadows less), and one for the background. Or, two lights for the face and one for backlight. Three lights turn out to be very useful. You need more than 2, and if you get 4 you may not use the 4th very often, so 3 is a good number to get.</p>
<p><img src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ISh-development/photos/large/524256a8533e8c30fe00000d/strobes.jpg?1380079267"" alt="""" width=""500"" height=""466"" /><br /><br />That's it! The most expensive thing is the camera and the lens. I strongly recommend sticking to prime lenses. Having the ability to zoom will actually distract you from taking good pictures. Next, a $50 reflector is the best use of $50, and if you have about $300 of 2013 money, you can start building your studio by purchasing a set of three strobe lights. Oh, make sure that your set comes in its own bag, which is extremely useful. Then, you can get a $80 background but you really don't have to - just be creative with your backgrounds. But if you have come this far, you'll probably end up with a background. And lastly - enjoy taking photos, and photograph every day! ^__^<br /><br />Related gallery: <a href=""http://piousbox.com/en/galleries/show/2013-photo-equipment/0"">http://piousbox.com/en/galleries/show/2013-photo-equipment/0</a></p>",2013-09-25 03:30:49 UTC
 Not all things are forgiven ,Not all relationships can be salvaged after infidelity.,"<p>Not all relationships can be salvaged after infidelity. It seems in our society that a lot of couples tend to &ldquo;work things out&rdquo; and move on, forget what had happened and start a fresh page. Not always. Sometimes sleeping with someone other than your gf/bf is the end no matter how much you try to tell yourself that you can get over the fact or try to think of the happy days you experienced. A friend of mine opened up recently about how his wife of 10 years had an affair. Women are just as guilty. The true answer is why &ldquo;cheating&rdquo; when you know the consequences? Her excuse was that she lacked attention from her then husband, who worked two jobs to support his family and put his daughter through college. Than tell me, what is the urge for betrayal knowing all of that could be lost and the family split? If you were truly unhappy why not speak, talk, tell him how you feel and what you lack, what you desire, tell him the truth. Sleeping with another person will not solve problems in your current relationship; it will not form a stronger bond and bring you closer together. It will either drive you far away from each other or teach you to forever doubt the other person. As my friend started to sense his wife&rsquo;s infidelity perhaps her conscious began to speak. He heard her conversation, read her text messages, and even saw pictures that were not meant for anyone else but her husband, being shared between the two. One night, after her escapade with the non-husband my friend asked her if she wanted to hear a tape he had recently come across which was a phone conversation between her and the other man. She realized what was happening and after an hour of silence came up to her husband and confessed of having an affair. Two kids, 10 years of a relationship, fights, happy days, wild sex, cuddling nights, crying together, experiencing any and every possible emotion that the world can bring and challenge a human being vanquished. The true question is why. Lack of attention is not a reason. It is important to realize that after the line of infidelity has been crossed it may not work out between you and your spouse/bf/gf. Things may not be the same, ever. Will you tell them that you love them? Love is not everything anymore; love is a component of a relationship, there are other factors that play a role such as trust, appreciation, respect. All of those are lost after unfaithfulness. Is it worth it? Was it worth it? My friend tried to stay with his wife, but the pain could not be overcome by him nor perhaps any other man (or woman). When it comes to infidelity it is crucial to realize that your actions may be the end of the relationship. The relationship that you have put time and energy into, the relationship that also involved another human being and their feelings, that even though you will be the one committing the action, the consequences will be felt by your significant other as well. Realize that after one is unfaithful it may not work out any more. Your partner may try to move on and forget of what you did, but it will not be the same. Not all people are capable of forgetting how they&rsquo;ve been hurt by the person that they believed were purely there for them.</p>",2013-05-06 00:06:02 UTC
An unlikely visitor,"","<p>My first visit. It takes four and a half hours to drive from Chicago to Pinckneyville. I woke up at 6am and decided not to shower, not eat breakfast just a cup of coffee and straight to my car. I was eager to visit and actually see him face to face rather than a phone conversation like it has been for the past five months. I had no expectations for the people working at the prison, people living around the area or him. I drove and drove, speeding wanting to get there as quickly as I could. Indeed it took me exactly four hrs and thirty some minutes to reach the exit that I needed to take. And I did, it was approximately another 30 miles to the prison. I drove slowly absorbing every little thing the town had to offer, and it wasn&rsquo;t much. Everything looked empty; houses were half a mile apart from each other if not more. There were no people walking around, cars were broken, the small stores available were shut down already. Every house had a chair or a bench in the front porch, as it was the only source of human interaction in the whole place, if anyone ever sat in those chairs to begin with. Continuing down the road I saw the prison. It looked exactly like a typical prison you would see in a movie. My lack of expectation for the prison was reinforced. I parked my car and was quickly informed that this &ldquo;was not visitors parking&rdquo; even though the whole parking lot was empty. So, I re parked my car, left everything besides my ID and $20 and headed towards the building, quickly. There was nobody outside, perhaps because it was cold out, or maybe<em> they</em> never get to go outside. I walked in and was quickly greeted with a dirty look by the correctional officer. I waited and waited and then waited some more, sitting there thinking of how strange it would be to live here, in the middle of nowhere, and what? Work at a prison? Do people know that there are better places out there, more interesting cities or is this &lsquo;okay&rsquo; and I&rsquo;m a stuck up city girl? Who knows but as eager as I was to get there, I was more anxious to leave. Patted down, half undressed and every cavity checked I was escorted to the visiting room. More of a high school type lunch room with octagonal tables bolted down to the floor and four benches attached to it and lots of vending machines (where my $20 came in handy), later found out were mostly empty. I was told where to sit and how to behave. I sat there and waited some more, I was bored and perhaps getting a little nauseous. I saw him come out and walk to check in with the guard and wanted to get up and leave. There he was, in navy blue uniform pants, and a light blue collar shirt with a name tag that said INMATE. It was repulsive and I wanted to disappear from there more than anything else. We hugged, and sat down&hellip; since then I have went back to that place more than four times, more than anyone should ever.</p>

Travelling on the budget: hostel v hotel. Which is better?,"Where to stay in a big city, any city - a hostel or a hotel?","<p>If you are under 35, and you are traveling to a relatively well-known city, a relatively large city, chances are there will be a bunch of hostels available. Hostels are different from hotels in several important ways. You do not get so much privacy, so if you are traveling with your significant other, perhaps it is not the best option ever. Although, there are hostels that provide private rooms and private doubles, perfect for couples.<br /><br />Cleanliness is also not going to be world-class. On average, a hostel is dirtier than a hotel. That is offset, however, by the price. A hostel is almost always cheaper than the hotel, so if you are traveling on the budget, it may be just the thing.<br /><br />Some people have a certain prejudice against hostels in that they think hostels are not safe. In my experience, although there can be plenty of thefts (why are you traveling with expensive shit and why are you not watching your shit?), overall hostels are pretty safe. Most of them provide lockers so you can put your laptop/passport in there, and you can use the backpack as your pillow, and when you travel you should be experienced in taking care of your stuff. That said, everything else regarding safety is good. There are no fights and no assaults - a hostel is just another place to stay, on the budget.<br /><br />The best part of staying in the hostel, however, is when it comes to nightlife and drinking/entertainment. You can meet a lot, no really, a lot of people in hostels. And everybody party. In fact, a lot of hostels are undesireable for me and for a lot of other travelers if the hostel is clean but not much social interaction going on. I personally tend to avoid such places - they are just like hotels for me, kind of boring. And I travel really light, so there isn't much to steal from me. <br /><br />So overall if you have never considered staying at a hotel, I suggest giving it a try. The best hostel site in USA is perhaps hostelworld.com, though it is by no means complete or the cheapest. But it will take care of 95% of your hostel needs.<br /><br />That about sums up my opinion on hostels vs hotels. Stay safe, and travel more!</p>",2013-04-24 07:06:36 UTC
What gear should I have riding in the city,An intermediate rider explains his gear set for daily riding in the city.,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My current residence is San Francsico (which means that I don't have to worry about snow, black ice, or starting a bike in dead cold) and I have been riding since 2009. Here, the helmet is not optional, it is legally required. Other gear -- well, I have seen and hear more than one opinion on what gear is necessary and what gear is silly/excessive, and I would like to share my own. The boil-down description of my gear set is: as much as possible that you can be comfortable with. There are some tricks, however, read more to discover ;-)<br /><br />To begin: the helmet. Very important, you probably don't need the most expensive one, but you should also not get the cheapest. Full-face helmet it should be. It should fit SNUGLY, which is important for safety. If you jerk your head left and right the helmet should not move much on the head. This guarantees that upon impact your head will not be bouncing inside the helmet, causing damage to your precious brain/skull.<br /><br />[pic]<br /><br />Next: and here is the trick number one. Security camera. The cops are infinitely more respectful if there is a camera pointed at them. I have this Contour Roam, which I highly recommend. It mounts well, gives good quality, and is waterproof (yeah I took it to a mountain waterfall, it really is waterproof). Besides, when you get pulled over, at least you will have some evidence for the court and maybe an interesting video to put on youtube, you never know.<br /><br />[pic]<br /><br />Next: Jacket. I have this one from Sedici. Waterproof, ventilated, with winter layer. It is a bit too hot in California on a sunny day, however I pulled all-nighters in it very very comfortably and I think it is worth it to carry it around (the weight!) and sweat in it. I used to debate: jacket or no jacket? The debate have been solved, and I wear jacket at all times regardless of trip duration or destination. Going clubbing, I put the jacket in coat check ($3). And if I must sweat in it, it is still okay because I know that if I have to ride home at 2am in pouring rain, I will actually be okay.<br /><br />[pic]<br /><br />Next: these waterproof pants ($20) are largely not used, however if I am riding out in pouring rain, I put these on over jeans or whatever. So I use them very very rarely but I think it is a good idea to have them.<br /><br />[pic]<br /><br />Next: And here is the trick number two: knee caps from a dirt setup. You can wear them under your jeans/pants. The way I ride I am not always most careful, and I don't want to have knee surgery if I fall. And also I don't want to wear horribly hot racing pants. Regular pants with these knee protectors do the trick.<br /><br />[pic]<br /><br />Next: Boots. Here is a picture of a scar I got from riding.<br /><br />[pic]<br /><br />You can see it is above the boot line... I was not wearing the boots when I got the scar, maybe they would help, maybe not. But, after getting this scar, I always wear boots when I ride. These boots are pretty cheap and my advice is that on other than first pair, do not spend less than $100 on boots.<br /><br />[pic] <br /><br />gloves. This is pretty standard.<br /><br />[pic]<br /><br />I bought a cellphone holder for the gas tank. I use it when I must be checking the GPS.<br /><br />[pic]<br /><br />tire pressuge gauge. Check your tires once a month. Correct pressume means better gas mileage and fewer tire replacements, which saves money and inconvenience.<br /><br />That is all, folks!<br /><br />[pic of myself]</p>",2013-04-21 22:34:14 UTC

Then a few months later there was another spider next to the first one, I guess they had the same logic/instincts driving them when they took whatever path through the house to end up in that particular spot, on the ceiling of the shower. And with that second spider there I notice how much skinnier the first one is. They are probably the same species and the first one was thin thin thin, perhaps it was already dead by then, whereas the second spider was healthy-looking. So for the next days and days I would look at them two spider there - and the second spider as well as the first one had no reason to go anywhere else, they just spent all the time in that corner, on the ceiling - and as I looked at them I thought, well the second spider is going to starve and die just as the first.</div>

Health Considerations While Traveling,a heads up to prospective travelers,"<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you start traveling you put your body in stress, whether you can physically feel it or not. And it does not really matter where you are traveling to, 1st world (Europe to America) or 3rd world (America to America). The fact that you are switching to a new, unpredictable diet and switching away from the normal routine will stress your body quite some ways. It is not bad, it certainly does not mean that you will get sick, however it is something to keep in mind when traveling.<br /><br />I met a girl in San Francisco and she was complaining how ever since she left Switzerland she has to put a lot of eye drops in her eyes, and cannot use her contacts. Something about the air here in San Francisco that makes her eyes very irritated. She is not sick, but she is certainly inconvenienced, and I think her immune system is working hard to keep her okay.<br /><br />Another friend of mine, when we were in Rio, after about a month he complained that his joints are all sore, that he sometimes fall asleep because of the pain. He sleeps with a pillow between his knees, and his joints are sore almost all the time. For no particular reason. It went away when he came back to Vancouver.<br /><br />Myself, I had a few minor things as well while traveling. In Sao Paulo I had my first experience with Conjuntivite, and in Natal, with atheletes foot. Both cured without complications.<br /><br />Overall, it should be noted by prospective travelers that, even if you are completely healthy and adhere to a good diet and exercise, when you travel you put a lot of stress on your body, and it is quite quite common to experience small health issues and inconveniences. Be ready for it if it does happen. Don't forget to eat and sleep when you travel! Drink plenty of liquids, and be careful with your body when you travel, and in general.<br /><br />\V</p>",2013-03-04 09:17:45 UTC
Welcome to Chicago,"Chicago is a huge vibrant city and sprawling metropolitian area. It is the home of the blues and the truth of jazz, the heart of comedy and the first builder of the skyscraper. Here, the age of railroads found its center, and airplanes followed suit. Butcher of hogs and believer in progress, it is one of the world's great cities, and yet the metropolitan luxuries of theater, shopping, and fine dining have barely put a dent in real Midwestern friendliness. It's a city with a swagger, but without the surliness or even the fake smiles that can be found in other cities. ","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><br />As the hub of the Midwest, Chicago is easy to find &mdash;its picturesque skyline calls across the waters of huge Lake Michigan, a first impression that soon reveals world-class museums of art and science, miles of sandy beaches, huge parks and public art, and perhaps the finest downtown collection of architecture in the world.<br /><br />With a wealth of iconic sights and neighborhoods to explore, there's enough to fill a visit of weeks or even months without ever seeing the end. Prepare to cover a lot of ground: the meaning of Chicago is only found in movement, through its subways and archaic elevated tracks, in the pride of tired feet and eyes raised once more to the sky. <br /><br />Many visitors never make it past the attractions in Chicago's large downtown area, but there are also many attractions to be found in the city's other districts. The city consists of three large Sides (the North Side, the South Side, and the West Side) each named according to its direction from the central business district, or the Loop as it is called. Citizens tend to identify strongly with their neighborhood within the city, reflecting real differences in culture and place. Rivalries between the North and South Sides sometimes run deep, while people from the West Side are usually free agents in critical issues like baseball loyalty. <br /><br />Chicago was known as a fine place to find a wild onion if you were a member of the Potawatomi tribe, who lived in this area of Illinois before European settlers arrived. It was mostly swamps, prairie and mud long past the establishment of Fort Dearborn in 1803 and incorporation as a town in 1833. It could be argued that nature never intended for there to be a city here; brutal winters aside, it took civil engineering projects of unprecedented scale to establish working sewers, reverse the flow of the river to keep it out of the city's drinking supply, and stop buildings from sinking back into the swamps &mdash; and that was just the first few decades. <br /><br />As far as Chicago's weather goes, well let's just say that Chicago is a huge city so things tend to get much more analyzed here than they would in other locales, that includes the weather. No, Chicago doesn't have weather like Honolulu - then again, what other city does? The winters in Chicago are indeed cold, but then again, so is most of the United States from Maine to Utah, with the exception of the extreme southern U.S. In fact, Chicago receives less precipitation (snow and rain) in the winter than East Coast cities like New York City or Boston receive. Chicago's summers are not much hotter than the East Coast, and definitely not as hot as the southern U.S. where there is a nonstop heatwave throughout the summer. There is a good time to be had in any season in Chicago, and the summer offers an array of parades, festivals, and events. <br /><br />Navigating Chicago is easy. Block numbers are consistent across the whole city. Standard blocks, of 100 addresses each, are roughly 1/8th of a mile long. (Hence, a mile is equivalent to a street number difference of 800.) Each street is assigned a number based on its distance from the zero point of the address system, the intersection of State Street and Madison Street. A street with a W (west) or E (east) number runs east-west, while a street with a N (north) or S (south) number runs north-south. A street's number is usually written on street signs at intersections, below the street name. Major thoroughfares are at each mile (multiples of 800) and secondary arteries at the half-mile marks. Thus, Western Ave at 2400 W (3 miles west of State Street) is a north-south major thoroughfare, while Montrose Ave at 4400 N is an east-west secondary artery.<br /><br />In general, ""avenues"" run north-south and ""streets"" run east-west, but there are numerous exceptions. (e.g., 48th Street may then be followed by 48th Place). In conversation, however, Chicagoans rarely distinguish between streets, avenues, boulevards, etc.<br /><br />Several streets follow diagonal or meandering paths through the city such as Clark St, Broadway, Milwaukee Ave, Archer Ave, Vincennes Ave, and South Chicago Ave to name a few.</p>

Welcome to San Francisco,"San Francisco is a major city in California, the centerpiece of the Bay Area, well-known for its liberal community, hilly terrain, Victorian architecture, scenic beauty, summer fog, and great ethnic and cultural diversity. These are only a few of the aspects of the city that make San Francisco one of the most visited cities in the world.","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>San Francisco is located on a small seven-by-seven mile (11x11km) square of land at the tip of a peninsula between the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific coast. It has a population of 815,000, but is the center of a metropolitan area of 7.1 million. San Francisco is just one of the cities which makes up the entire San Francisco Bay Area. San Francisco's neighbors - municipalities to the east of the Bay Bridge, north of the Golden Gate Bridge, and south of the city are all part of separate counties, each with their own governments and local public transportation.<br /><br />Walking can be an enticing option to get from one neighborhood to another, so long as you are aware of where you are and keep your street smarts. San Francisco is a city of friendly neighborhoods, but it is also a big city so be aware of your surroundings and keep in mind the dangers that commonly accompany a city of San Francisco's size.<br /><br />Perhaps the most recognizable landmark in San Francisco and one of the most famous bridges in the world, the Golden Gate Bridge, spanning the Golden Gate, has been called one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World and is the first thing you see of San Francisco if driving in from the north, as it is one of the major road routes into and out of the city. Overlooking the Golden Gate is the Presidio, a former military post with beautiful architecture and a very scenic park setting. Within the Presidio is the gorgeous Palace of Fine Arts, built for the 1915 Panama-Pacific Exposition and reminiscent of Roman and Greek architecture.<br /><br />The best way to find a good bar or club is to ask the advice of a local; but barring that a copy of The SF Bay Guardian or the SF Weekly will help you find something suited to your personal taste.<br />San Francisco is very much of a ""scene"" town, with a varying range of categorical experiences. If you want door-to-door bar hopping at friendly bars that serve PBR tall boys, definitely go to ""Polk Gulch"" in the Tenderloin and work your way up through bars such as Mayes, The Playground, and Hemlock.<br /><br />Text borrowed from: wikitravel.org</p>

How often should one travel?,"After i cross the border, any border, after the daily routine falls off and my habbits reduce to none, after my information intake reduces to actually talking to people, instead of staring at one screen (two, five screens) the whole day - some time after i leave e States, i feel tremendous freedom. And the effort to leave is worth it.","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>A friend of mine said once, like you travel and after a while you start tripping out. You dont need no drugs or nothing but your whole being, it seelf like you are on a fucking mushroom trip. It is a great feeling. From myself i would also add: yess all that, and more. When tripping without drugs, you have complete control and complete certainty that what s happening around you is actually real. The best ""drug"" available out there is not a dubstance, but a behavioral pattern. The best drug out there is the jet lag. The travel.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But eventually i come back and some days later, i feel this fear, like things are sinking back in the fog. The routine takes over, and you soon forget the joy uou felt, and similarly the effort you spent on getting out.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So how often should you travel?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I say, as often as you can. Getting out on a long weekend once a month is great. Travelig for a week once in 3 months is great. Basically the goal is to never sink back into the routine. Travel enough to always feel this ""trip"" that is the unusual behavioral pattern. And, you probably want to optimize the costs so, if living at home is the cheapest opion, you wantto travel just enough to be in the jet lag zone and not sink back into the routine. Ideally, you would think as your home as not home, you would think of anywhere you are as travel. So, how often shold you travel?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I say, let's start with once every three month, ad see where that takes us ;-)</div>",2012-09-14 03:37:31 UTC
Hello Moscow!,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hearing the word Moscow, what directly comes into mind is the Saint Basil's Cathedral. That beautiful cathedral where different colored arches on their roofs makes it a very famous tourist attractions.</p>

It holds much of the great architectures and structures as well as holds a nice city life where everybody - not only Russians could enjoy. Airports, terminals, cars, and other modes of transportation could be seen in Moscow. What makes this city accommodating is the people and citizens living in it. Moscow not only holds the great structures but it is also considered to be the home of one of the world's most expensive coffees.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">From rich history books to real-life experience, Moscow has a lot to offer. From cathedral structures to footpaths to foods to tourist attractions, Moscow is like a capsule.

FTIM Portal :: Why Travel?,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought I needed an excuse even, for traveling. Like, why do I go to this place or that? I don't know... And it is in fact exhausing, I see people get all sorts of mild deseases and fuckups when going to a completely different place. This one girl from Sweden, she says, she cannot wear contacts in America. Not that the client here is bad, it's just her body is not accustomed to it. Or this one guy from Canada, when he was in Brasil, he said, after 1 month he had like extreme joint pain, could not sleep because of the pain. Nothing wrong with his body, but traveling does get exhausting. So why bother?</p>
<p>Because! The best people! Are found in travel. And some of the best experiences. Surely it is inconvenient and expensive. But I can go to a hostel an in 5 days meet people who could be my best friends... if we were only in the same city for any length of time. That's how I am with all my best friends: they are all somewhere else, on other continents. Sometimes it makes me sad, but every time I experience this mode of travel, it makes me happy.</p>
<p>And it is not like the people are very different. Perhaps they are, but not by much. No it is the environment that makes them different. The mode of travel itself, makes them change their behavior. Tourists are nice. They are mesmerized by the beauty of things. I find internationals (tourists and students) my favorite kind of people. No prejudice, they accept most things as they are. Having experienced more than one culture, they are open-minded and see things that would evade a `local` eye. When I travel I trust people in a specific way (and mistrust some other people in another specific way). When I am settled, I do not have that clarity of judgement... and the people around me, those that are not immediately travelling, do not have the clarity of judgement either.</p>
<p>When traveling, you have to be quick. Sometimes you have only a day to make friends - although not I think that one day is really not enough, you need at least 3 days. But that is still very very little! A community that forms within 3 days is a strong community indeed. And there is so much happiness! When the behavior is light like that, it makes everybody happy. Settled life does not quite provide the happiness that I look forward to, when I travel.</p>
<p>So that's the reason. Exhausing, expensive, inconvenient? Sure. But the best people can be found there. The best people are <em>made</em> there. And after a while, it is just like pure happiness, the joy.</p>

An old shop on a new street,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>As I am walking down the Hollywood Blvd in Los Angeles I see a lot of interesting stores all around. It is kind of peculiar, actually: the Hollywood Blvd itself is packed with people, but you go one block south and there is noone there. So, I am walking down and I hear this guy half-say haf-sing, ""salvia, mushrooms..."" I turn to him and say, you have mushrooms for sale really? He says, yes come into the store. And so I do, and browse their stuff. They have mushroom for sure, but I decide not to buy any, just whatever. The other goods they have are, sunglasses, watches, souveniers. I don't buy anything. Just when I walked out, it occurred to me that the gift shop is old! The couple running it is old, and the stuff they have there is also old, maybe good value, maybe not, but it looks not modern.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>See, I woke up, walked out of the hostel, and the first thing I bought was sunglasses just across the street, and then I was like why not? And bought actually three pairs of sunglasses from that dealer. Yuip I lost one pair just yesterday, a girl came over and took them off my head, out it in hers and said, it is mine now. So I had to get another pair and if I lose/break them as the average rate of 1.5 per week, I may as well get more than one pair.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And at that old shop I bought nothing. The store next to it probably has hundreds or thousands of dollars in sales every day, and there are maybe dosens of people in it at any time. But the old store, I was the only guy browsing the items, and when I left, nobody was there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Why am I saying all this? Because it occurred to me. Even if something has value, and you think you would lose value by losing that item - it may not be the case. I think the best thing that couple could do is get rid of their whole inventory and buy new, cheap, flashy, shitty stuff from scratch. Like the pairs of glasses that I bought (twice overpriced, as I found 1 hour later, but no matter). So, if you have a bunch of stuff that has some value - maybe, just throw it out. It weights down on you so, and without it you may regain the value relatively quickly, and what is more important, increase your capacity of gaining value, which is more important than the value itself. Do not be attached to old things. Just throw them out, or give them away to someone, and start from scratch, and feel happy, and be free. That is all ;-)</div>",2012-09-03 03:04:13 UTC
Experience with the Whalesharks,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When I had my summer vacation, I came to experience a personal encounter with these gentle giants. They came in threes, fours, and even more. It was just recently in that town, where the whalesharks came to visit and because of a discovery of one fisherman, that they can be fed, so the townspeople and other fishermen decided to give small shrimps to these giants. Maybe these whalesharks have an information chanelling among them, because they got many all of a sudden and they come to visit the place every now and then. And &nbsp;all of a sudden, because of the surprised visits of these giants, the town also became a tourist destination.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Almost every month, people coming from the different parts of the Philippines and the world, flock to the town just to witness and have a personal encounter with these giants. Of course, these whalesharks have to be protected, so there are laws, rules and regulations on the whale shark watching in the town. Like you are not allowed to go very near to the whalesharks nor touch their skins. A watcher has to stay 5 meters away from the tail of these gentle giants and all other rules that protects it.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When I had my first encounter with the gentle giants, I was afraid and scared that I might be eaten by the whalesharks. It seems like when they open their big mouths, with me this small, it seems like they're going to eat me up. Waaaa. But one thing is for sure, they do not harm humans not like the hammerhead sharks and the white sharks which when provoked, harm others.</p>",2012-08-20 03:41:56 UTC
Philippines,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I love to travel. I love visiting other places most especially going into historic and Spanish-old places. I love visiting museums and see the different artifacts that were collected during different eras and centuries. The Philippines, which was under the Spanish rule for more than 300 years have a rich source of historical stuffs. When you go visit the different provinces, the Philippines can offer you a lot of it. An archipelago, the different provinces of the Philippines also share different stories based on the artifacts and edifices that are being built in these places. Cebu is one of theses provinces which showcases different stories of its history.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When I went to the southern tip of Cebu, I passed on one of its municipalities, Boljoon. I was amazed on how the church surpassed the changes of time and how it was able to stand the changes of the weather. The geographic location of the church contributed to the ambiance of the place. The church stood there facing the sea. It was such a great marvel and a wonderful place to be.</p>

Round Trip To Australia In 2 Days (Or How I Got Deported From There) ,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you guys have any idea how far is Brazil from Australia. It&rsquo;s like the other side of the world. The quickest trip goes thru the South Pole. No, I couldn&rsquo;t seen any Coca-Cola polar bear from the plane. I think I saw an iceberg, but that was all.</p>
<p>About 4 months prepping for that. I&rsquo;ve managed to pay about 1,000 dollars for it. It was a Qantas promotion, so I bought it in advance, last november. So the only thing missing is a Visa. No problem so far. I already have an american visa, I&rsquo;ve have a canadian one, I&rsquo;m well traveled in south america and even been to Europe. I have my own company (two, actually) that supports me financially so I can travel without worrying about money. All good. I even bought a lot of aussie dollars from an ex-staff member from <a href=""http://www.limetimehostels.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">LimeTime</a>, also got some American Dollars and even Euros that guests from the <a href=""http://www.limetimehostels.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">hostel</a> ask to exchange.</p>
<p>A girl friend of mine dates another friend of mine that is from Australia (Hello, Jason and Roberta) recently went there and she told me they ask for a Yellow Fever Vaccination card. No where in the visa form this is mentioned. But anyway. I have been to Peru twice, and they also ask the same. I got my shot about 5 years ago, but I just don&rsquo;t remember where it was kept. So I decided to call the Australian Visa Central or whatever they call it, that ironically is located in CANADA, and I ask about it. They told me that yes, its a requirement, but if I didn&rsquo;t have it with me, they would ask me to sign a form saying I was responsible if something happened, yadda, yadda, yadda&hellip; Well, fine then&hellip;</p>
<p>Whomever follows me on Twitter or Facebook knows all about my preparation. All my friends dying to see such a good friend leaving for such a long time (just a freaking month).</p>
<p>Well, guess what? One of my hobbies is DJing! Yes, I mix dance music on night clubs so people can dance and have a good time, and so do I. I don&rsquo;t do it for the money, but only because I like doing it. I have no intention of becoming Calvin Harris and go around the world on tour. (Hope it happens, lol) But I wouldn&rsquo;t skip the chance of DJing in some parties in Oz. After all, most of the tunes I play comes from there (Hello, Bag Raiders).</p>
<p>So, one of my former guests at <a href=""http://www.limetimehostels.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">LimeTime</a> just so happen to work for Modular People, the label for Bag Raiders, Van She, Muscles, and so on&hellip; And when there was a Smirnoff Night Life Exchange party here, he put me in contact with Tim Poulton, that works with him and is the booking agent for those bands. We become friends and he was looking for some parties for me to DJ. Not only him as all my friends there, since I have plenty that I&rsquo;ve met thru the <a href=""http://www.limetimehostels.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">hostel</a>.</p>
<p>And since I have more than 1800 friends on Facebook and I dont know exactly where all of them are from, I decided to create and event and invite all my friends, and they had the option to confirm if they were in Oz so we could meet up. On the event I decided to write &ldquo;If you know any party promoters, help me by getting gigs. Im bringing my DJ stuff, and looking forward to party with you all! :)&rdquo; It took a while for anybody to confirm me on any gig, so I was already kinda hopeless. Some friends told me about other promoters, clubs, etc, when finally Tim sent me a message to confirm a gig. So we exhanged this messages on Facebook:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey mate,</p>
<p>&nbsp;First set I have for you is April 29th in Sydney, will that work for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To which I replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure&hellip; Im leaving Syd on may 4th, so ill be there. Whats the name of the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src=""http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljaaw7hU6y1qbtt4a.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>
<p>Notice that at any moment we mentioned money. For the same reason I mentioned above. I didn&rsquo;t wanna do this for the money. If by any chance they offered me anything, I would probably spend it all on booze at the same place. But that was never my intention. All I wanted to do was to mix some electro with some brazilian music that the crowd would like, get the aussie girls worked up, and luckily get out of there with someone! :P</p>
<p>Now the drama begins. The flight was alright, pretty long, but good. I decided to not take any of my equipment, not even my laptop I took with me. Only took my Hard Drive cause I was planning to buy the new Macbook Pro there. Tom (not Tim) has a BCD 3000, the same I used to use before, so that would be enough for me. Not even my big DJ headphones I took with me. Only my In Ears that I&rsquo;ve been using lately (Kudos to Laidback Luke).</p>
<p>So, going thru immigration, obviously they asked for the Yellow Fever Card. First Mistake. But I already knew what was going to happen. Or I thought so. I&rsquo;ve been sent to another person that asked me to wait there. He came back and asked if I had a cell phone with me, cause I couldn&rsquo;t keep it with me while there. So I gave him my iPhone. Suddenly the same guy comes back and asks me what I do for a living. I told him I have my own <a href=""http://www.limetimehostels.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">hostel</a> in Sao paulo. He insists. I insist on the same answer. So he asks me what I was doing in Australia. Vacation, I say. He insists again, and asks if there was nothing else I was meant to do there. I told him no. ANd he says My facebook and twitter says otherwise. Boom&hellip; That&rsquo;s when I got in trouble.</p>
<p><img src=""http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljabjfCQOI1qbtt4a.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/garfolino"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">@garfolino</a> Just got my first gig in Sydney! :)</p>
<p>Just after Tim mentioned the party, I posted that on my Twitter. The problem is that for me GIG is just a party to play. Apparently GIG is slang for WORK!</p>
<p>So they print this out along with this other tweet:</p>
<p><img src=""http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ljabovl2Q21qbtt4a.jpg"" alt="""" /></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/limetimehostels"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">@limetimehostels</a> Bebeto is off to Australia tomorrow! If you&rsquo;re there, join the event! Le Garfs Invades Australia!</p>
<p>There, now they are all freaked out.</p>
<p>So it starts a series of interviews and questioning about my intentions there. I told them I have no reason to be working there, that I have my own company that supports me very well financially, told them how much money I make, how much money I took with me (they counted it with me), showed them my credit cards, told them how many friends I have there, and all&hellip; I told them DJing is just a hobby, that I have no intention of making money out of that, I just wanted to have a good time with my friends.</p>
<p>Then it comes to the second biggest problem. They found Tim&rsquo;s number on my iPhone and called him. He didn&rsquo;t know what was going on, so he told them details about the party that even I wasn&rsquo;t aware of. He confirmed the gig, told them the venue and when they asked him if I was getting paid, he says Well, yes, we pay DJs 50 dollars per hour. That&rsquo;s when everything went to crap. But he even said he didn&rsquo;t know how he was going to pay me for that since I dont have an ABN. (I dont know what ABN is, im just assuming&hellip;) So, I couldn&rsquo;t receive that money. Ok, Its Australia, not Brazil, so everything must be done correctly.</p>
<p>I insisted that I have no idea he was planning to pay me for that. That I never talked to him about money. So they asked me for my Facebook password, which I promptly gave to them, but they couldn&rsquo;t access it since when you try to log on facebook from a different part of the world, they ask for a lot of confirmations, so it doesn&rsquo;t get hacked. If they needed my help for that, Id be more than happy to help.</p>
<p>So, no deal. They asked me to give a last statement telling them whey they should not cancel my visa and let me stay.</p>
<p>So I told them all again. I was there as a tourist, and just so happens I&rsquo;m a DJ, that yes I wanted to DJ in some parties with my friends, just as a hobby and for fun, and I have no intention to make money out of that, because I really didn&rsquo;t need to be travelling there. For me, it&rsquo;s just like bringing a guitar and play at the beach, is that work? No deal. They cancelled my visa. Apparently, DJ is a profession indeed in Australia (it&rsquo;s not in Brazil, yet) and to DJ at parties means work for them, even thou you&rsquo;re not getting paid for it. I even promised them that if that was the case, I wouldnt do it. In my mind all I was thinking was that if they let me in, I wouldnt get anywhere close to a DJ booth. Again, no way, Jose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, the airport was about to close and the only flight back to Brazil was on the next morning. I&rsquo;ve managed to get out of the airport, scorted, of course, to an Immigration Detention Center. I forgot to mention that I lost my jacket on the boarding gate in Buenos Aires. So for me not be cold, they even gave me another hoodie to keep. I was never treated badly by any of them. Only when they gave me frozen chicken, that I obviously didn&rsquo;t eat, so I was hungry until the next morning when we went back to the airport.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s me, Brazilian, DJ, <a href=""http://www.limetimehostels.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Hostel</a> owner, detained (not arrested), in the middle of a bunch of chinese people and people from other places that were obviously there trying to get illegal jobs, just waiting to be sent back to my country. Good thing is that I got my own room, so I just laid down and slept.</p>
<p>6 am they knock on my door and wake me up. I got release from that area, and they took me back to the airport. The whole time I was hoping somebody would come and say that it was all a huge misunderstanding and overrated, and would apologize and let me in. Silly me. I got locked up a bit more there, until they put me into my flight. But at least, they were nice enough to go to McDonalds for me and buy me some food. At that point I was starving.</p>
<p>Well, here I am, back in Brazil. And I&rsquo;ve learned a few lessons. Set your Twitter account to PRIVATE. If it wasn&rsquo;t for that, they wouldn&rsquo;t know anything. And always take all your documents when travelling. If I had tried harder I possibly would have found my yellow fever card. I bet if I look for it now I can find in less than 30 minutes. And third. DJ is a profession in Australia. Always deny that you can mix music together.</p>
<p>On the good side I didn&rsquo;t spend any money in Australia, so I bought a new Nintendo Wii with Mario Kart for the <a href=""http://www.limetimehostels.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">hostel</a> at the Free Shop in Argentina.</p>",2012-08-03 03:06:16 UTC
Feel The Beat Of Jozi,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept of Ubuntu is my link to all that I observe- this is the way individuals of all races, genders and culture are connected. Our social economic standards don&rsquo;t matter. All you need to know is what a beautiful country we live in. If you get off your comfortable bottoms and come explore, you will feel and know what we live within and around. This exposure will provide no help to people who have lived here before. They know about the glorious weather, the big five and how the bush connects strangers. This one goes out to the people that think we ride to school on lions and have giraffes as pets. This stereotype will not do, so come and see what is really going on. We are a collective of new and old, and always inspired to be as real and raw as it gets. Come and see the way Johannesburg people live together, help create opportunities for one another and share their open hearts with whoever requests it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I live for the streets. They let me know what is happening. The street vendors are like hawkers, creating opportunities to sell at traffic lights wherever you travel. You could easily buy an entire box of fruit, a new pair of sunglasses and a car charger from the comfort of your own car. They present township art as a classic and will always be a souvenir to bring home. They capture what you experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jo&rsquo;burg taught me to drive. Cape Town made me walk. I walk not knowing what will find me, and enjoy the lack of expectation every time it arrives. Each journey leaves me with an impact. This is not just a trip, but a destination. When you interact with the people here, they make you feel a part of this place. &nbsp;The people living on the streets teach me something every time I venture out my house. They live for simplicity- bread, kindness, a form of shelter and conversation. So I urge you to come and visit and see who takes the time to share some words and ask how you are.&nbsp;</p>

The most interesting thing about Fernando de Noronha,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fernando de Noronha is an archipelago in Brasil, near Natal (the airport of interest for visitors). It is beautiful, there are things there that do not exist elsewhere. The existence of the fragile ecosystem is made possible by the island's location: it is very far from the mainland, which fact few islands can boast of. <br /><br />Your plane ticket from Natal to Fernando de Noronha is likely to going to be as expensive as from wherever you at to Natal. Yes, this is an expensive place to visit. Because it is so remote, the plane burns a lot of fuel. Because the place is not as popular as, say, Paris, the prices are way up.<br /><br />Another interesting thing is that the Brazilian government sets the restriction on the number of tourists that can be on the islan (500 at a time I believe) in order to preserve its ecosystem.<br /><br />The most interesting thing, however, is that this island used to be a prison. Again, because it is so remote... Kind of like Alcatraz, but much much more intense. So, they used to go to great lengths to put prisoners there, and now it is one of the top world tourist attractions, expensive, luxurious, exquisite, rare.</p>",2012-07-24 12:40:19 UTC

Johannesburg represents an entire population that conglomerates the past, present and future, constantly finding an innovation that works for the diverse communities that have settled on this land. This is the land where Huguenot housing placed important status on Dutch influences and Afrikaans roots. This is where the Khoisan (ethnic African hunter and gatherer types) collided with the Boere to battle against the origin of land and resources. Who does what belong to? Who came first? Over here, all that matters is the next step. </span></p>

Freebies in DC,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start off with, I decided to join some early-bird queues to watch the daily and weekly performances that had on offer. This particular Sunday had an event at Meridian Hill Park. The weather explored raindrops, but immediately cleared up the afternoon for a drumming circle. African nomads in a park, in Washington, on a Sunday, who would have thought? As I listened to the drum beats and watched individuals join in, I managed to find a stranger to dance in circles with. Boy- was I happy. I can&rsquo;t remember the last time I was consumed by a drumming circle. I was even offered my own drum to join in the beat, and until early evening, I managed to keep my rhythm going. This was matched by another free performance of lyrical jazz duets and slam poetry positions at Stage&nbsp;the next evening. I didn&rsquo;t mind going alone because I knew how responsive these Americans were, even though I doubted it at first. I even got up to recite my own words, clicks and shakes were welcome, the people were so supportive. In two days, I managed to feel the vibe of the city without its historical connotations. I plan to visit Rock Creek Park for a tour of the night sky tomorrow, and for the next day, I will check my list out. All I know is I am definitely looking forward to the next few days.</p>",2012-07-03 19:20:39 UTC
New York: Island Metropolis,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New York is one of the greatest places in the world to visit! It is truly the center of American culture. Some of the best television shows made in America are filmed in New York City! If you are a fan of &ldquo;The Daily Show&rdquo; or &ldquo;Late Night with David Letterman&rdquo; for example, think about waking up early and getting in line so you can be in the studio audience! If you're looking for a chic party experience in New York City, think about going to Dream Downtown and partying until dawn. The ground floor of the building is a dance club that has been known to bring in some DJs of incredible quality. One of the coolest things about Dream Downtown is that it is also a hotel. Consider this place to be your base of operations! The floor above the dance hall even has a fantastic restaurant with a celebrity chef! If you are a fan of rap and hip-hop music, I would suggest visiting S.O.B.'s. Despite the colloquially vulgar name, this night spot features some of the best young and up-and-coming rappers in the country. Some of the most popular rappers out today got their start here. If you want to soak in the urban culture for a night and experience some ridiculously talented lyricists (and your sensibilities aren't easily offended), S.O.B.'s is where I suggest you go. For a relaxing afternoon to escape the hustle and bustle that is apparent in the majority of town, visit Central Park and lie in the grass and have a picnic with a loved one. I still remember the first time I set foot in the park and took in the sight. It's an amazing thing to be is such a beautiful, green oasis completely surrounded by elegant high-rise buildings. It's easier than you think to book tickets for a fabulous Broadway show and experience classic American theater productions, such as the recently performed Waiting for Godot, featuring Nathan Lane and John Goodman. Perhaps you want to catch something new and Avant-Garde? There are a lot of off-Broadway productions that provide unique, quality productions at more reasonable prices. Who knows? Maybe you might catch the next big star performing in one of these smaller theaters! One of the most unique bars that you can visit in the city is Crown Victoria. This is one of the most famous outdoor bars in all of New York City. It's the perfect place to casually drink some beers or sip some martinis as the sun does down and the breeze begins to whip through the city streets. There are even fun amenities like table tennis and badminton courts. Who would have thought there was a bar where you could drink while playing badminton? They also have some fantastic food and drink specials which will help you keep a little change in your pocket as you explore the city. If you do have some money to burn and you have some expensive tastes, hit up Madison Avenue! There are blocks and blocks of stores on this street, many of which are flagship stores for some of the most elegant brands in the world! It might be worth it to splurge on a couple of accessories on Madison Avenue, just to say you've shopped where the most fashionable people in the world go to shop! You could spend a lifetime in New York city before you've discovered all the fun you can have here. I can't wait to go back!</p>",2012-07-03 11:53:16 UTC
Berlin rocks!,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're looking for a place to chill out during the week and have a few drinks, Fuchs und Elster is a great spot to consider. Even though it can get a little crowded, it's still a great place to hang out for some cheap drinks and some time to just talk to your friends and draw up your next plan to adventure through the city. Come the weekend though, the cellar of the bar becomes a pretty fun club to visit, featuring soul and funk music, and the party tends to last all night. If you want to be a part of the German soccer experience be sure to plan a day around football at Alte F&ouml;rsterei stadium, home of FC Union Berlin. Get in the mix and have a damn good time, but remember as a tourist to be sure to root for the home team; you don't want to get yourself into trouble with the Berlin's fervent fans. You are a guest! If you consider punk rock and indie music your thing, I highly recommend the Magnet Club. It gets some really entertaining punk and alternative acts from around the world in addition to being a thriving spot in Germany's indie and punk scene. The venue has two stages and even if there isn't a band rocking out there is sure to be a dance party rocking. Club Lido is another great place that focuses on rocking out. The primary types of music that play here are Rock and Electronica. Expect a crowded atmosphere with bright lights and blaring sound to take you out of yourself for an evening as you experience some amazing European and German acts perform intense yet ambient music for fantastic audiences. During off periods, it's also a great place to catch a football game with some gregarious fans. For an elite, world-class orchestral experience, go watch the Berlin Philharmonic perform. Even though there is so much great musical culture in the city, and the punk, rock, jazz, and electronica acts are top-notch, nothing really compares to sitting at the Philharmonie and watching some of the most talented human beings on earth perform their craft to an adoring audience. For casual drinks and dinner, be sure to visit one of Berlin's famous Beer Gardens. The oldest of these that is still in operation is the Prater Garten. If you are looking for a more casual yet refreshing atmosphere, this is the place for you. It offers beer and drinks from noon on and dinner later in the evening, and having a beer in the Beer Garden is one of the most relaxing experiences you can have in the city. There is so much to do in Berlin and this just represents the tip of the iceberg. Be sure to schedule a lot of time here, because there is no limit to the adventures you can have in this affluent international capital.</p>",2012-06-28 08:31:56 UTC
Prague in the Summertime,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prague is one of the most satisfying places to visit in Central Europe. It really has everything to offer, especially if you are into any kind of nightlife. One of the most popular destinations when visiting Prague is making the tour to Pilsen to visit Pilsner Urquell brewery, home of the oldest Pilsner beer in the world. This brewery was established in the 13th century and is still in operation. The classic Pilsner Urquell that you've tried at your local bar is nothing in comparison to the home brew, and there is just no excuse not to go. There are also brewery tours in the city that take you to the many brewpubs across the city of Prague itself. It really is a beer-drinker's paradise. If you are into the club scene, one of the best spots to visit is Karlovy Lazne, which is a huge club that is located close to the Charles Bridge. When you step in and look around your mind will be absolutely blown by the size of this place. It's the biggest nightclub in the entire region and it is always packed from floor to ceiling, especially in the cool, crisp air of the Czech summers. If you're more into a relaxing bar experience that will really suck you in, visit the Cilibar. As opposed to the electric air of the Prague nightclubs, this bar, and ones like it offer a relaxed atmosphere with great drink prices and even better tasting martinis. It is easy to get lost in the haze of this amazing bar and leave much later than you were ever expecting. For a more laid back experience after nursing that Central European hangover, visit the awe-inspiring Prague Zoo. This is one of the oldest, maintained zoos in Europe and has been recently recognized by Forbes magazine as one of the greatest zoos on the planet. Tigers, lions, polar bears, and giraffes, among hundreds of other animals, roam their enclosures across the fascinatingly beautiful landscape. Prague has a lot more to offer than most people would think. It is an entertaining, vibrant city with rich history and a really jumping night life. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to visit the region, and once you're on the streets, it's friendly to any budget.</p>",2012-06-28 07:34:50 UTC
"Camden Town, British Boondocks in London","","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The market is cluttered with around 200 stalls pawning off second-hand stories, vintage is a core word used around here. All eyes are clued up on the best bargains on jewellery, furniture and clothing. Naturally, my clothes fetish increased while walking through the market imagining swimming in the capacity of thrift goods surrounding me. Even though the cold hisses and spits its rain, and the miserable cold and grey undertones to the scene, Camden breathes with creativity. On the outskirts, people-watchers stand by, with cameras and snacks in hand, and watch as every outrageous and expressive individual walks by. It&rsquo;s as if London was born for outcasts to develop. Their style evolves as rapidly as their drinks are poured. Draughts during the week days are common. If you don&rsquo;t have a skill and have come to live the London life, a bar will take you in instantly. There begins the weekly pay for entertainment. The youth are never stagnant or stuck, because transport is so available. The Tube and bus system are organised for people to get around when need be. This is greatly useful for people&rsquo;s party ethics. While the transport is going on, and being attended by a large percent of their population, their asset is getting to and fro. Public transport is definitely a plus. Music has its own culture this part of Britain. Individuals flock to bars and clubs for concerts, tickets are yearned after. That is why barmaids and patrons work for their piece of tuppence per night shift, in order to purchase a ticket to their favourite gigs weekly. I jumped on that route when visiting. I managed to watch Crystal Castles and Santigold in the time I was there. It shook my world around knowing that music was so close to my surroundings. I definitely needed to visit London once a year. The reason I came to London was to visit a couple of friends who were living here. Yes, I came as a tourist, but in my own right, I felt part of the Brit crowd that live day in, and out in this city. I enjoyed every last bit of London town, the culture sucks you in and excites you, even when you run out of toilet paper at home.</p>",2012-06-27 02:57:47 UTC
"Havana, Cuba","","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was a part of a tour group during my stay, and witnessed the heritage sites during the day. The Vi&ntilde;ales Valley was found after the expansion of tobacco cultivation. I kept my nostrils flared trying to breathe in the smell of fresh tobacco, but the cliffs leading into the valley didn&rsquo;t look as safe as I wanted them to be, so I chose stability instead. This site was known for military placements in the Cuban War of Independence, as well at the Cuban Revolution. Che Guevara came up a lot; his iconic stance has really been embraced by the world today. On one of the days out, I learnt that Havana was founded by Spanish colonists. The city was built in the Baroque and Neoclassical styles, which are seen through the city. Its beauty is embraced by all who live in it. At night, I needed my space. Early evening strolls had become a favourite of mine. When I stepped out of my lodgings, I never knew what would happen or who I would run into. I always found myself using the pathway to the sea known as the Malec&oacute;n. It made me think of the old pirates capturing natives who hid behind barrels trying to steal food and woman from the ship&rsquo;s docking days. What I would do to encounter a hostage situation with a Latin pirate off-shore. The Captain would take me to sail through the seven seas. He would eventually allow my liberty and let me join forces with his crew. Anyway, side thoughts aside, Havana captured me. I am definitely coming back to explore some more.</p>",2012-06-21 00:00:00 UTC

The fans, also known as &lsquo;hinchas&rsquo; have a massive amount of enthusiasm for their soccer players. Being part of a community that puts all their energy into supporting their local sports team made me feel really good. My friend and I cooed at the boys, who are ridiculously handsome. I finally saw the appeal of a soccer player doing his thing on the field. Their swift athletic moves keep everyone interested. I have never been more amused to watch a ball be passed up and down the field. They are fierce. Watching a live match made me understand the hype Argentineans&rsquo; associated with soccer. I finally got it, and I had no judgement attached to it. I was glad I came to find the origin of this culture. It really captured the enigmatic qualities I had hoped I would find. Next visit, I plan to watch another game, it brought out a great energy in me.</p>",2012-06-21 00:00:00 UTC
Albuquerque,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon arrival in Albuquerque, visitors will quickly notice the Sandia Mountains that dominate the skyline. This is where the adventure truly begins for visitors. The Sandia Mountains feature towering mesas, deep canyons, and vast lakes. Hiking trails guide visitors along the mountain range and ski resorts are available throughout the winter season. Visitors may also tour the Sandia Mountains via the Sandia Peak Tramway. At 2.7 miles long, the tramway provides a unique and surreal view of the mountain range thousands of feet above the ground. Riders often rave about the experience of flying through clouds beside some of the state&rsquo;s highest peaks. Ballooning is a popular activity in Albuquerque and one that is sure to offer visitors the thrill of a lifetime. The city&rsquo;s mild, arid climate and unique natural landscape make it the ideal location for hot air balloon rides. Balloon tour guides can be found throughout the city and New Mexico. Balloon Fiesta, the world&rsquo;s biggest festival for hot air balloon enthusiasts, is held annually during early autumn. Visitors will find some of the most affordable prices in the country for balloon rides in Albuquerque. After a day of enjoying outdoor adventures, Albuquerque offers visitors a unique flavor of city life. Fine restaurants reflect the city&rsquo;s cultural blending by offering a number of dishes with historical and international influence. Spas and old west saloons offer adults a chance to relax and unwind, while the city&rsquo;s zoos and theme parks bring families together. When the sun goes down, the fun continues with luxurious casinos featuring all-time favorite gambling competitions and clubs that offer the latest in style and music. Some of the biggest names in Albuquerque entertainment will even offer visitors a free ride from one of the many affordable hotels to their establishment. Albuquerque&rsquo;s history spans even further back that the nation&rsquo;s in which it resides. The Native Americans have called this region home for many years, and their influence can be seen and felt throughout the city. Ancient ruins remain throughout the surrounding area and mountains, providing a look into the life of ancient civilizations that resided here before. Many residents continue the traditions of their ancestors by providing visitors with pottery making classes, ancient celebration practices, and much more. The art and architecture featured throughout Albuquerque also reflects the rich history that helped build this sprawling city.

A (Roma) adventure.,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>

I am ready to savor the food in front of me as a companion. I wasn&rsquo;t able to finish this rectangle delight of cheese and bread duo, so I downed the rest of my wine, paid my bill, and looked up for inspiration. The Torre dei Lamberti was calling my name. Now that my stomach was satisfied, I wanted my eyes to have the same feeling. I shoved my backpack behind me and started making my way to the top. I decided to save my Euros for food and brave the stairs. After a half hour, I reached the top.

Weak for Paris,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told tales of the rude inhabitants the French people conveyed. I prepped myself for the tone I would receive. I learnt French to counteract that. In the time I had started saving, I took up French audio lessons. I was adamant to have a conversation in their native language. The language barrier was no more, this entailed being part of their society, instead of repelling it. I visited the Louvre. I was completely taken aback by the Parisians commentary on the glass pyramid structure in front. They were never impressed with the modern context of it. After a five minute chat with a Parisian art collector, I acknowledged their arrogance in the culture and switched off my intellect for Paris. Instead of belonging, I opposed everything. It made those intoxicating nights wittier, having a collection of opinions. Debating became my favourite act to meander while there. En route to the infamous tourist attraction, I was amazed to find out that the Eiffel Tower was made entirely out of scrap metal, from start to finish. Startled by the height at first, we made our way to the top, which closed as we arrived, due to the weather conditions. We settled on the middle view, and by George, it was magnificent. This city could never be mundane. It glows. It&rsquo;s alive, and it was all mine for a month to fall in love.</p>",2012-06-18 00:00:00 UTC

With an approximate of 150 000 trees surrounding this piece of land, my lungs attached themselves to the abundance of oxygen that nature enhanced, and then fuelled up with fresh air. I lay down. While the clouds scattered the sky, the sun&rsquo;s appearance was warm and majestic. The weather here made me feel whole and new. This sun was consuming me. Back home in London, sun was a moment of freedom. This moment felt like a generation of new life. After taking a lengthy stretch, I moved towards a path that I saw from the corner of my eye. Moving towards the Brockton Oval Cricket Pitch, I saw the eight Totem Poles gathered together. I moved in really close and stared them down. Spirits of ancient tribes were trapped in an animalistic character, and I was trapped in their stories. These monuments all have an individual connection to the land, all full of history and culture. I took my moleskin out and created my own narratives. I just happened to be in the park the same day as &lsquo;Dance as Dusk&rsquo; was scheduled. I was thrown into an array of people leading me in lines and circles to traditional folk music. No partners were needed. Strangers made the effort to join in. I was thrilled, and lucky to have been there at the right time, right day. To this day, I still use my trusted point-and-find method.</p>",2012-06-18 00:00:00 UTC

Like two water drops are similar,"","<p>In the raging 90's I had a job on the side, fixing electronics for friends and friends of friends. Me being an engineer and knowing the craft, the side gigs allowed me to get by the decade of recession relatively easily (Translator's note: the Russian economy and politics of the 90's were crazy, that's why they are dubbed ""raging 90's""). I mostly worked at this small village that was close to a big city, yet did not have any repairs / customer service for the electonics. This allowed me to pretty much own the market there. Although I had to walk 12km to get there, eventually I bought a bicycle and got to be quite efficient. I would take the train, then bike it 12km there. (Translator's note: commute in Russia is nowhere like commute in USA. A bicycle on the train is a rarity.) In this village I got to know this one dude really well, sometimes I would even sleep over at his house if I finished work late. He had grown-up kids: the older sister was a police capitain, and two younger brothers, twins, where just about to graduate from the local polytech college. (Google map http://bit.ly/z1GBHR). Them being twins, I could not for the life of me tell the difference between them, but they weren't upset. Eventually they also provided me some work, mostly referring their friends, for me to fix their boomboxes. (Translator's note: a boombox would in those days be perhaps the most advanced electronic device owned by anyone in a remove village.) Once the twins finished college their sister hooked them up with the police. In the raging 90's it was hard to get a job anywhere, so they were fortunate for their sister's connections. One went into OMON unit, another went into the homicide unit. (Translator's note: OMON is the police unit chiefly concerned with managing then-common protests, demonstrations, and other urban events.) A mere year later I could easily distinguish the twins. The guy in the OMON grew some muscle and became this characteristic strongman. The guy in the homicide unit, on the other hand, became bleak, sad and sick-looking. Their father complained to me: the first son gets to be on the open streets all the time, has everyone's respect in the village, even bought a car (then-rarity in Soviet Russia). The second son, however, has to deal with corpses every day, gets no perks and no recognition at all. And hence, two twins who were at first indistinguishable to me, became quite different due to the nature of their work.</p>",2012-02-03 20:06:32 UTC
A Face Crime,"","<p>Evening time, I'm riding the railcar home, listening to my iPad. I customarily put the volume very quiet so that I can hear what is going on around, but people around me perhaps assume that I cannot hear hem. Two women sit next to me and discuss my appearance, trying not to make it too obvious. They giggle as they discuss my jacket, hoodie and hat. I look out the window with my poker face on. Then one of them says to another: ""look at his happy snout, he is probably coming back from a hooker!"" At that moment I couldn't resist and looked her straight in the eye. The two women got embarrassed, stopped talking about me and stepped off the railcar shortly after. The funny thing is, I was actually coming back from my mistress to my family! So the two women, although did not know, were right. And now I am seriously considering what they say about the benefits of eating a lemon after the love joys.</p>",2012-01-31 06:26:36 UTC
Old mans secrets,"","<p>&Acirc;&ldquo;As you may know, - he replied &Acirc;&ndash; young folks usually go to parties in evening. And guys always accompany girls home. Through central street, of course. If you walked together once &Acirc;&ndash; it means nothing. If twice &Acirc;&ndash; it is a kind of a reason. And if you were seen together for three times, you are unofficially recognized as fianc&Atilde;&copy;. So once I have accompanied a girl. We were talking when I had felt that she was getting her hand away. I was misunderstood. In a moment I saw that I was going directly into a puddle, but hadn&Acirc;&rsquo;t turned away. She had skirted the water and held my hand again. The next puddle was chosen specially. She had repeated her turn. The next day I went with another girl in the same way. And she behaved similarly, skirting the puddles. The situation repeated in a day. I went with the third girl talking to her and she held my hand strongly. I stepped into the water and she followed me, listening carefully. She hadn&Acirc;&rsquo;t mentioned the puddle. Then I went to another one which was deeper. No changes, she was still following me. We stay together since that time, living in peace and love&Acirc;&rdquo;. Everybody stood with their mouths wide open. Those ones, who are older, asked granddad why he hadn&Acirc;&rsquo;t told about it earlier. So they may know how to choose a wife and be happier.</p>",2011-11-10 08:00:00 UTC
In time of war,"","<p>Year 1942, city Stalingrad (CCCP). Nazis are preparing an attack by tank echelon, with the intent to cut off the Soviet partisan forces from Volga (a river, a supply route). The only way to stop the Nazis is to blow to shits a warehouse, as found by the the Soviet reconnaissance, where the attackers kept tank fuel. The generals issue an order to destroy that warehouse. Colonel, commander of regiment RE-2, understands well why the order is issued to him: he has the only remaining dive-bombers on this frontier... but the dive bombers have not returned from the last mission. Yet the Colonel must comply with the order. The only flying machine under the colonel's command is a ""??-2"", a plane designed for transporting mail and antiquated by every measure. Its payload is 200kg at most, whereas the bomb necessary to blow up a military warehouse - fortified for the war - needs to be heavier. The Colonel orders the regiment'm mechanic: ""Hang a `pyatisotka` on external locks."" A pyatisotka weights half a ton. ""The locks will break... The plane won't get off the ground."" - Colonel's comrades express their opinions. ""This is an order."" ""And who will fly it?"" - they ask him. They well understand that this is a suicide mission. ""Bring me a headset and a parachute,"" he answers. ""You cannot fly, Colonel."" - the mechanic tries to talk him out of it. ""No, to fuck with the parachute, its just extra weight. Just bring me some vodka."" * * * The plane, rumbling on the last breath, by miracle takes off and, not even trying to gain altitude, sets course for the enemy's lines. The plane due to overload is barely controllable, it cannot fly straight but rather tries to swirf sideways, it near turns upside down and loses balance. But the Colonel is a true ace, and he continues stabilizing the plane's course for 40 minutes, until he near reaches the target. Twice on his way the enemy's fighter jets fly over him, but they either did not notice him or thought that it is not a plane, but rather a truck or a cart. Close to the target, the plane's engine works on overdrive. Smoke comes out, the engine overheats, and it destabilizes more and more. On the ground, the enemy anti-aircraft defence stands by but they do not make a move, do not fire. However, the Colonel doesn't pay much attention to them, he is busy. The plane's engine is failing. Here is the last hill, here is an entrance gate, another warehouse, almost there... The Colonel pulls the release trigger. The bomb falls, explodes. The plane jumps up, regains stability, and begins to fly away. The anti-aircraft opens fire, but it's too late and the Colonel is now too far. Mission accomplished: the warehouse burns to the ground. A german commander personally arrived to that warehouse to see why the anti-aircraft did not open fire. For him, this was a high-value object and he spent quite a bit of resources - troops, fighter jets - protecting it. The crews of all anti-aircraft dots said the same thing: they thought it was a plane going down, it was making saltos in the air, it was burning up and smogging all over... planes do not fly like that. The Colonel, upon return, got issued a reprimand by disobeying the bylaw prohibiting him from flying missions. Marshal Timoshenko, commander of the Stalingrad frontier, issued the reprimand, then shook the Colonel's hand, hugged him and customary kissed three times on the cheeks.</p>",2011-11-03 07:00:00 UTC
Rio II,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20101130 Woke up, delayed release I was still stoned. The way Zhenya bid me farewell was prolonged. It took us about a month of time to say good-byes to each other. We were getting down, Jamaica-style, every weekend and sometimes more often. As I said to the close circle of my friends: if I know a rastaman---Zhenya is the rastaman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kerry, I didn't say good-bye to him much. On the last day, when he was giving me a ride to the airport, he still didn't know where I was going; he thought I was going to San Francisco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lala, we were saying goody-bye to each other for a long time as well. The night when we rolled together the last time (at Kinetic) was very good. E sex was good, until 6am. We only stopped because she had to go to the airport, she left to Las Vegas that same day. And the last night we spent together before my Rio experience was good as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The day I left, it was snowing. I was very happy, very. I had a 10mg adderall and figured, this is the day I take it. I rolled on adderall till the transfer in Charlotte. So, in Chicago I bought possibly my last cup of coffee (mocha) from New Wave, and walked around in freezing temperature in the mannner of appreciating the neighborhood. Then I finished packing (packing took me two days. I feel like I always live on the move, ready to move out any day). The car ride to the airport was not interesting. I don't enjoy Kerry's company, I have to admit. But, he enjoys mine. He apologized for being fucked up the last few months---and that is right, he is fucked up. I didn't mind it so much because I was hanging with Lala and Zhenya all the time. But enough of this. I was really happy to take one last walk around my neighborhood. It is okay, Logan Square is good. I had good experiences in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to express just how happy I was, running around the 'hood, packing my things, re-parking my bike, and taking care of the last arrangements. Of course, I missed some things. I should have brought more money. But enough of this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a gorgeous girl at the airport. Mulata, fake blonde, in stilettos. My goal here is, besides the cultural shock, to experience many of these, and possibly marry one and bring her abroad to the U.S. And my agenda is pretty open, I'm not hiding from anyone what I am about to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20101201 adderall trip before departure; very happy before departure; flawless transition the gorgeous woman at the airport, blonde hard skin, stilettos. checking in, is my cash enough?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20101202 The experience of today (first arrival to Rio) reminds me of the trip I took to D.R. Dominicanrepublicanization. Come to think of it, it was a great experience. An independent travel outside U.S., a first hooker, and all around fucking awesome. And I got the elephant lucky charm that is in my pocket right now. As long as I have it, perhaps I'm safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20110106 Yesterday, went out to a samba place with Gus and Pej and Raj. Got some nice videos of them and the DJ. Overall, the experience was pretty boring. Emporio is a great place to pickup bitches, they just hang out over there, ready to be picked up. By Che Lagarto is pretty nice too, some girls are way young. I think I like young girls a lot, and the young girls like me. And the older girls like me too. Friends say that Brasilian women are difficult. I think northamerican women are difficult. Andre from Che Lagarto thinks that northamerican bitches are easy, and that Brasilians are difficult. I think the opposite. Perhaps, it's because I don't belong to this culture and he doesn't belong to that one. Whatever we don't have we consider exotic. Things I am doing: work development portuguese Went to Walk on the Beach to hang out with Gus but instead hung out with everybody else there. Two very attractive girls, one was with a guy another was available (or had boyfriend overseas) so I was king of hitting on them two, but nothing kind of worked out. Came back to the hostel with a bunch of guys, one was gay and the other two probably were not. So we hung out on the beach and smoked a joint. Such things apparently happen a lot in Rio: come back from a party, hang out on the beach, smoke a joint. A great day at work, I hope the mediatec people appreciate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>20110107 Things specifically I am doing: get a job with an international company (a bank?) not-do complete myself There is a pain in my body, it is the pain of my body aging. I become aware of my body in this way: it hurts so I am more aware of it. But this pain gives me an opportunity to hurry up. I don't have much time here, and I must finish everything I have before time runs out. Hungover. Last Friday I was walking around looking for a wife. I looked in the mall and on the streets and on the beach, but I didn't find her. That's okay, I don't expect her to be found in one day. Maybe I have already spent a month on the task. Maybe I have already spent 12 years on it. The way party happens, the way wifes happen I think is by accident. Or rather, you have to be correctly in the environment but the environment takes care of you, and in ways that are unexplainable. Yesterday for example, I hung out at Walk on the Beach and it was great, but in December when I was there it was pretty horrible. So what I need from a wife is the support she would give me when I am working, right? But right now I do not have the infrastructure to accomodate her: I am not settled. As soon as I am settled, I will be able to find me a wife, and if not a wife then at least someone who will fulfill the same purpose: make me relaxed, make me more correct in my behavior.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A thing I am preoccupied with the most is the not-doings. Yesterday I was walking around after my half-day at work and I thought: I am not walking, I am running. I can almost feel myself, but it takes a bit longer. So I wait and train more. I believe I can actually complete my recall. It was meaningless the first 10 years but now I think it gives me an understanding of myself that I would not achieve otherwise. So, I keep going with the recall. It is somewhat similar to learning a language: boring, time consuming and difficult. I am learning Portuguese now. It reminds me of how I learned English. Right now I am several months into the program. This way I felt when leaving Junior school perhaps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spending money too much. This week I spent about US$1000. Per week, that's more than I am making so I have to be careful. I can go down to Argentina (and I will go there anyway, for tango and women), it's cheaper there. But Ju said it is a bad idea to mix languages like that. Either I should learn Portuguese, or Spanish. If I do both, there'll be a language soup in my head. I listened to her advice and then I said: Ju, thanks for the consideration but I will go down to Buenos Aires and make a mess of my languages. But thanks. I think she understood what I meant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have time to do everything I want to do. Again, I'm doing too much. Perhaps I should stop with the development of my own things while I learn Portuguese? And I do not spend enough time working. Only 15 hours a week, but I have difficulty giving them that much time. Well, it was the rave at Forte de Copacabana. A stage and maybe 5,000 people, it was pretty good. I got videos. Afterwards we went to Emporio and everybody bullshitted a lot. It just so happens that I banged yet another girl. I did not enjoy it, almost. Her pussy was not very tight, and she was not very attractive. Maybe 7.5/10, so according to most standards she would be quite attractive, but for me she wasn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I have very high standards. Gobani rapped quite a bit at night. Me and Pejman and Guz got stoned and Gobani was just walking around being all healthy-like. He impressed me in some ways: he hits on girls a lot, he talks to them in a proper manner. It is surprising to me that he hasn't succeeded with anyone here. Pejman should also be able to succeed, I don't know what their problems are. I fucking score just at random moments. Gobani commented, ""don't put your fingers into somebody else's vodka."" That is the wrong thing I did last night: attempting to drink someone's vodka without permission. I would actually pay them, but I was rude to begin with, and the argument just didn't go through very well. But, there was no fight, it was okay. There was a fight at Emporio, a bunch of guys just hitting and kicking each other for what seemed to be no reason at all. I found it amuzing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People who tried to disengage the fight also got kicked and punched. At Lapa Lapa, we went to a whole in the wall bar and there people were dancing samba to live music, and this guy took his girl and brushed her ass over my crotch. I mean, they were dancing and then the dude kind of turned their couple dance into a triple dance with me, although I was just standing there. He sandwitched his woman with me. I didn't like it, I disengaged in a rude manner: fucking pushed the bitch away and walk out. I didn't like it. But apparently Pejman did, he said there were three girls rubbing against him. The locals, they tried being social with me but I found it unpleasant that they do that to my body. Of course, I do it to other people's bodies as well. It is something to consider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Che Lagarto met an interesting guy, he just arrived a few days ago and he was looking a little lost. He became a good friend of mine in a slow manner: not like, I see you and you are my friend. It took us two days to get to know each other a little bit. Same with Pejman: at first, I thought I'd only hang out with Gobani but then Pejman kicked in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I notice now that I am quite unfriendly to a lot of people. I do not necessarily say hi to somebody who may become my new best friend. I am sexist (shovinist), I give men much more credibility and responsibility than to women. I punish aggressively, I am possessive and mean. I consider some people inferior to me and consequently limit my interaction with them. I think that all people are enemies, that everyone is an animal and my first assumption, when meeting someone, is that they are looking to fuck me up. There was a very beautiful young mulata at Emporio, 17 yo great body great skin great face. I would marry something like that, in the manner of a trophy wife. Not someone particularly close to me, but certainly something beautiful. There is a dillema: do I marry a young one or do I marry an old one? The young one, I can educate her about whatever I want, make her think whatever I want, and help her avoid making mistakes. But that would be just a small reflection of myself, perhaps not very interesting. On the other hand, I can marry someone older and mature who have experienced many things. She will not be pure, but she will be interesting. Theoretically, I should stick with the latter type. So here in Brasil, and banging young girls in general, it is one entertainment and not progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gustavo e um pessoa nao confianc,a, ele e atrasado tudos vez, nao use seu cellular, etc. Eli deu uma mulher eles celular, duas ves. Ele e um pouco fraco. Mas, algumas vezes isse nao e falter de ele. Gus usa demais drogas, eu espero que ele apagar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Lapa, walking around communicating with locals. Pejman tried to pick some girls and I did not do that. Emporio is better than Lapa. The party at Leblon is better than Lapa. Melt and Emporio account for a very good time. In terms of employment, in Sao Paulo I will apply for a few jobs, apply for CPF and talk to companies about what's up. I will also look for companies that do business between Brasil and Russia. So the last three days I postponed my trip to Sao Paulo. It was worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Sao Paulo, Floripa. After Floripa, Buenos Aires. After that, either Salvador or I don't know. In Buenos Aires I will want privacy. I think I will get a private room on day one, to make a statement about the condition under which I am travelling. Andre bang't a girl at Lapa right in front of everybody. She was wearing a very small dress. The girl was quite attractive but apparently very stupid. This is not me. I don't think I would do something like that (although I have raped Lauren in her sleep).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm happy I met Danielle what's-her-face, the most attractive of the three northamerican bitches at Che Lagarto. She is a bitch, no denying it. She knows that she is beautiful and she plays with all the guys who interact with her in this way: she lets everyone give her stuff and she gives nothing back. I thought, that pretty bad and I'm not going to deal with it. But, it's not that simple. She is undenyable beautiful. That's worth something. Also, she is not necessarily promiscuous. She didn't want to kiss me many times, as many times as I have tried. So when she is someone's wife, maybe the man will be okay, he won't have to think that she bangs everyone she sees on the street. Also, from the point of view of women, I am probably very similar to Danielle. I am a very attractive guy. If I am going out with Pejman, a girl will ask me to kiss her. Then if I say that I don't want to but here Pejman does, she will say that she doesn't want him, etc. So I am handsome and I am a complete asshole. I bang them and leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I don't like the woman, she won't get anything from me. First and foremost, I consider them a threat. Second, I consider them mechanical pleasure givers. And I am strong, capable of causing people considerable difficulty. Perhaps, from the point of view of women, I'm even worse than Danielle. Another thing that she teaches me is absolute certainty and the applicability of same. I am pretty sure that if I really wanted Danielle, given enough time, I am able to make her do anything I want for me. She has her walls all around her protecting from potential bad-doers, but she doesn't have the mind to make these decisions as to what she actually wants. So, if I wanted to, I could have had her in any way I fancied. What happened was that I didn't have enough time, and I was distracted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides her, during out last night at Lapa I met a guy who told me that I should seek females who reply to me, not just sexy fuck dolls. And also, besides Danielle there were many other very attractive girls in that group and I got distracted by seeking a one that is the easiest to obtain. I continue looking for women, for the right one and for many ones to give me pleasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I continue sculpting myself, my body and mind and memory and the footprint, everything that exists. I wished for o Deus... I wanted to overdose on ecstasy and coke and acid, in a country I don't know, where they speak a language I don't speak. I wished for o Deus to crush me with his mighty fist, crush me into non-existence. I thought to myself, I am ready now so o Deus, if you want me, here I stand. And nothing happened. I am still alive today.</p>",2011-10-21 07:00:00 UTC
Things to do in Chicago,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city's lakefront allure and nightlife has attracted residents and tourists alike. Over one-third of the city population is concentrated in the lakefront neighborhoods (from Rogers Park in the north to South Shore in the south). The city has many upscale dining establishments as well as many ethnic restaurant districts. These include the Mexican villages, such as Pilsen on 18th street and La Villita on 26th street, the Puerto Rican enclave Paseo Boricua in the Humboldt Park neighborhood, ""Greektown"" on South Halsted, ""Little Italy"" on Taylor Street, just west of Halsted, ""Chinatown"" on the near South Side, Polish fare reigns at Belmont-Central, ""Little Seoul"" on and around Lawrence Avenue, a cluster of Vietnamese restaurants on Argyle Street and South Asian (Indian/Pakistani) on Devon Avenue.<br /><br />Downtown is the center of Chicago's cultural, commercial and financial institutions, and home to Grant Park and many of the city's skyscapers. Many of the city's financial institutions (for example,, CBOT, Chicago Fed) are located within a section of downtown called ""The Loop"", which is an eight block by five block square of city streets that are encircled by elevated rail tracks. The name ""The Loop"" is sometimes also used to refer to the entire downtown area. The central area often is portrayed, as in the map at right, to include parts of Near North Side and Near South Side, as well as the Loop. These areas contribute famous skyscrapers, shopping, museums, a stadium for the Chicago Bears and convention facilities. Similarly, the area just west of the Loop and the Chicago River contributes to the commercial core.<br /><br />The North Side contains Lincoln Park, a 1,200-acre (490 ha) park stretching for 5.5 mi (8.9 km) along the waterfront with the Lincoln Park Zoo and the Lincoln Park Conservatory. The River North neighborhood features the nation's largest concentration of contemporary art galleries outside of New York City. As a Polonia center, due to the city having a very large Polish population, Chicago celebrates every Labor Day weekend at the Taste of Polonia Festival in the Jefferson Park area.[48] The Chicago Cubs play in the North Side's Wrigleyville. Two North Side neighborhoods in particular, Lakeview and the Andersonville area of the Edgewater neighborhood, are home to many LGBT businesses and organizations. The area surrounding the North Side intersections of Halsted, Belmont, and Clark is a gay district known as ""Boystown.""<br /><br />The South Side is home to the University of Chicago, and the Museum of Science and Industry. It also hosts one of the city's largest parades, the annual African American Bud Billiken Day parade. Burnham Park stretches along the waterfront of the South Side. Two of the city's largest parks are located here: Jackson Park, bordering the waterfront, hosted the World's Columbian Exposition in 1893 and is home of the aforementioned museum; slightly west sits Washington Park. U.S. automaker, Ford Motor Company, has an assembly plant located on the South Side. Also, most of the facilities of the Port of Chicago are here. The Chicago White Sox play at 35th Street.<br /><br />The West Side holds the Garfield Park Conservatory, one of the largest collections of tropical plants of any US city. Prominent Latino cultural attractions found here include Humboldt Park's Institute of Puerto Rican Arts and Puerto Rican Day Parade, as well as the National Museum of Mexican Art and St. Adalbert's Church in Pilsen. The Near West Side holds the television production company of Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Studios and the University of Illinois at Chicago. The Chicago Bulls and Chicago Blackhawks call the West Side home at the United Center sports arena.</p>",2011-08-29 07:00:00 UTC
Natal,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll tell you guys what happened in Natal. I went there off-season and I was the only guest at the hostel, although the weather was as good as always---it rarely gets bad in the north-east of Brasil. I get off the bus and look for the hostel, walk around until I finally come to the right beach and there are a bunch of fishermen there, friendly as only Brasilians can be. One of them the moment he sees me comes up and says, ``hey man what's up? You need to go that way.'' Why? As he later explained, he sees a white guy like me with a big huge heavy backpack looking all confused, it means I'm going to Ivan's hostel. One thing I learned that day is that a Russian may not outdrink Brasilian fishermen. They drink caxasa, which is Brasilian vodka with rum flavor. I wake up the next morning so hung over, and still drunk, with 50 mosquito bites from sleeping in the open air. Come morning, other fishermen come in from the sea with their catch. A beautiful ?angel fish, it's all-gray but you look at the scales closely and you see that they refract light, that they are rainbow colored. Gray and all-colorful at the same time. Ivan says that these fish may be illegal to catch in the wild and that at a restaurant a small one would cost R$150, but he knocks the price down to R$30 from the fisherman, and we buy it for dinner. I judge it to be the best fish I ever had. It's off-season and I'm the only guest. Intermittently drunk and hung over, I hang out with the hostel owner for four days and hear his story. Ivan, he is from South Africa, he says the first thing he noticed when he sees me is that I don't look Afghani. Oh, in my reservation I put down that I'm from Afghanistan, for shits and giggles. Ivan is looking for an Afghani but a Russian comes in, go figure. As we fought the hangover by continuing drinking, we walked all over the village, and to everybody Ivan was saying hello, talking about little things. ``This guy, he said, this guy renovated the hostel. He looks like a small skinny guy, yes? But he works hard, what two workers would take three days to complete, he does in one day. Hey, tio! Tudo bom? Como vai voce?'' And so forth. It took a long time for us to buy spices to cook the fish, because there were like four people at the store and Ivan had to talk for a half-hour with each of them. Actually besides me, there was one more guest at the hostel. Luci, she came over to help take care of the dog. Ivan, he has this beautiful basset hound, a favorite of all guests, nobody can resist to pet him - even me, although I'm allergic. But the dog is stupid! He runs around right, being all happy-like and he jumps to this kind of a small wall in the back yard and jumps down on the other side... but the other side the wall is elevated maybe 6 feet tall, and basset hounds don't have long legs, so the dog breaks its leg... Ivan takes him to the hospital and puts a cast on it, but the dog is stupid, right? So it tears the cast off. Another recast - the dog tears it off as well, and then walks around limping and crying, not understanding why there is hurt. So Luci, Ivan's friend, comes over to take care of the dog right? The hound needs a lot of care, he will need a metal rod in his leg, an expensive operation, and all the while he has to be restricted, he can't just run around b/c he'll damage his leg more. Ivan says, when he walks into the room where they keep the dog---the smallest room in the hostel---Ivan can smell adrenaline that the dog sweats out because of the pain. And Ivan's father died like two weeks ago which pains Ivan also. I can see that when Ivan walks around town with me, introducing me to the locals and being all friendly-like, no he's hurting on the inside. His brothers start immediately fighiting over family business, Ivan says he will not take orders from his younger siblings... he maybe has to sell the hostel even though he just got it two years ago, maybe go back to South Africa... And Luci and Ivan keep fighting so hard, drinking and fighting and I'm sitting there too, drinking and watching them fight. I hear Ivan say to Luci, ``I wish you were beautiul but you are fucking ugly!'' And other things along these lines. Ivan is like, ``she's a whore! Hey Victor you want her? Seventy bucks and she's yours. Look at her, she's such a fucking whore.'' And I think---well, I mean... Then Luci is like, ``Victor come over here for a second... Look that if Ivan does this to me, doesm't mean that you could okay?'' And she bites she shit out of my arm! I still have the scar. I'm like, wtf? I turn around and Ivan is standing right there watching us, but he turns and leaves. Anyway, we keep going and then notice that we don't have any weed (anymore? Was there weed in the beginning?) and so Ivan says oh he knows a dude way in the farms who is his only supply. It's maybe 10pm and Ivan is like, okay is he going or is he not going there? Want some weed? Heck yeah I want some weed, Ivan is like, ``no man you just now where like reluctant, if you don't want it that's it, I'm not going. Nope, sorry, I'm not going. And you are not my friend anymore, you're a fucking asshole. Don't talk to me or Luci like that. Man I'm not talking to you. And I won't cook your fish, cook it yourself, your fish.'' ``Ivan, look at me. You play this drama in front of my face and you want me not to react? You offer her to me for seventy and you want me to do what exactly? Dude, you're talking like that in front of my face...'' Anyway, after awhile he goes for the weed, it's maybe midnight at this point. And I'm what? I cook the fish, eat and drink, Ivan isn't back for a long time so I fall asleep on the hammock... The next morning (4am or so) I wake up and Ivan is yet with another friend, smoking cigs and drinking the rest of caxasa and he's like, oh my fucking back... man what happened? He says, he went to the farm but the fucking dude there didn't pick up the phone and didn't open the door, although the lights were up and there was someone in the house, but Ivan couldn't get in (midnight, right?) so he's walking back home in this shady hood, the buses don't run anymore, and two police cops come up to him and be like, what's a white boy doing here in the middle of the fields? But Ivan doesn't have any drugs on him b/c he couln't get any! He's just drunk so the police, being Brasilian and all they just beat him up a little, so Ivan walks around all crooked like, saying ``my fucking back man! It's killing me.'' Then I guess, he came back while I was still asleep, he was still drunk, he starts talking shit to Luci again. And she punches him in the face! I didn't see that but I see Ivan with a black eye, and he walks around bent over and mumbles, ``fuck my fucking back hurts so much. I shoulda got that cops' names and numbers why the fuck did they beat me up for'' and so forth. And in the morning (10am) when I went to sleep again, I guess Ivan being all hung over, he proposes to Luci. He says to me later, they know each other for 5 years on and off. She came over to take care of the dog? Not really. * * * The rest of the days we spent kind of getting over hangover and feeling awkward about the whole thing. Ivan apologized to me several times but I really don't see a problem with what happened. As a friend of mine said, stuff like this doesn't really happen to people, you don't expect to check in a hostel and see such drama so maybe I am looking for it, and maybe I am. From mosquito bites that I got on the first day I got allergic reaction, huge blisters and sunburns where no sunburns should be. I go to the doctor who is a very nice guy and he prescribes me four things, antufungal and antibiotics. ``Doctor is that really necessary? Four prescriptions?'' ``Yes, because you are really fucked up.'' ``Okay. Doctor, in USA I was prescribed adderall but I run out, can you give me some?'' ``Okay.'' So as an added bonus, I got 300mg of Ritalin, equivalent Adderall, from this whole experience. After a few days, we all sober up, quit freaking out, and I leave for my next destination.</p>",2011-08-18 07:00:00 UTC
Leaving Rio,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can tell you guys how I left Rio. After a month the weather got to me, right? It`s so hot there in the summer, I constantly felt like I was running a mild fever. Even a local arriving from colder parts of the country went to the doctor b/c he thought he was bitten by this insect that makes you sick, but no it was only that the sun is so hot. Without sunscreen you will burn in 30 minutes on the streets. The sun makes me feel like the world is getting smaller: it`s difficult to pay attention to things that are far away, under that sun. Which isn`t to say that it`s bad---I love it, and I love Rio! But after about a month I had a sudden urge to move out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me and the Vancouver group (Page, Arash and also Gus) bought tickets to a rave at the Copacabana fortress. I made it so that it was on the last day of my stay, so it`d be a good closing event. We went to the rave early, say 3pm, and it wasn`t open until 5pm. The ticket said that it opens at 1pm. The organization of events in Brasil is sometimes pathetic. We bought VIPs which let us in before all others, and gave access to the VIP area which really wasn`t that much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was buying drinks and they were giving me regular drinks like whatever, which is pretty tiring. So I said to the bartender at one point: a baccardi and be generous please. So she fucking gave me a full glass of baccardi! I should have asked earlier, b/c by that time I was so fucked up, after a while I dropped it and was like, no I`m done drinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gus gave me coke and I went ape nuts over it, I wanted to do it more and more, I`d overdose if I had any coke on me that night. But things as they go, I just got a bit crazy and didn`t sleep for a long time so it was okay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Met a bunch of ravers who came over to us b/c we were dancing like ravers would.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Almost got into a fight, it was my fault. I touched someone`s vodka bottle like I was gonna just drink it, whereas in actuality I wanted to ask whoever the owner is if I could buy a shot from him. A misunderstanding, basically my fault. Whatever, nothing happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rave was generally good. I didn`t meet any girls at the rave but it was okay. Afterwards, we were walking on the beach and Arash was rapping like crazy, I got it on video. We bought coconuts and hung out on the sand for awhile. Then, we went to Emporio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guys I was with perhaps didn`t like it. They were standing around looking at the crowd but not approaching anyone or doing anything. Talking to a few people, yeah. Then they left, but at the hostel I guess it was boring so they came back. I stayed there the whole time, it wasn`t boring for me. I kept on drinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end of the night, one of the black girls who spoke english just offered me to go to a hotel with her. We took a cab to the favela, went up to the room and fucked. I wasn`t expecting it but yeah, I got laid the last night of my first stay in Rio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I came I was like, okay I`m going home. That upset the girl greatly. She wanted to cuddle and maybe have sex again. She wanted me to relax. And I said, I ain`t gonna relax baby. So I left. I didn`t even pay my share for the hotel room, she said she`ll take care of it. That was a bitch thing of me to do, and now I think I was quite heartless doing it. I`m sorry. The girl was nice to me, she let me bang her pussy, and I treated her like a thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At maybe 7am I left, went back to my hostel, slept a little bit, woke up in time for regular checkout, and left for Sao Paulo.</p>",2011-07-31 07:00:00 UTC
"La Giudecca - Venetian Festival, Irish Interlude ","","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">The Fiesta- the Biennale</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">: An old friend from Nagasaki invited me to Venice to cover the Biennale Architecture Exhibition, and to stay with her on the island of La Giudecca. Wonderful for a writer: both the theme (&ldquo;People Meet in Architecture&rdquo;) and the 2010 director of the Biennale, a Japanese woman architect, Kazuyo Sejima, appeared to signify a great break with tradition.&nbsp; And it did&mdash;signify a break, I mean. It was wholly wonderful. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">The setting</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">: &nbsp;La Giudecca is a small Venetian /island which now boasts international features: a new Hilton Hotel <em>and N</em>YC style graffiti, &ldquo;ALL CITY CREW.&rdquo; &nbsp;But then La Giudecca has always had a fluid past. Its very name is a rumor, possibly a corruption of the Latin ""Judaica"" (""Judaean"") or Jewish ghetto.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">It is a warm enveloping village. A chorus of &ldquo;Ciaos!&rdquo; broke out whenever we walked to the local bar (<em>osteria</em>). &nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone on Giudecca seemed to know everyone else. Conversations were lively---about children, education, dogs, the high waters, and the terrible state of the economy. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">Some Giudeccan women were much in vogue, elegant, etiolated (gladiator sandals, four-inch heels), swaying as if on the catwalk. &nbsp;Others in housedresses, with missing teeth, gray hair worn in buns. Virtually everybody held a cell phone in one hand and a lit unfiltered Camel in the other. Offering a Camel was a regular part of the meeting and greeting ritual.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">Conversation in the osteria focused on children, tourism, and the waters.&nbsp; Everyone commented on the <em>aqua alta </em>or high waters. Venetians constantly exchange intense accounts of the stages and effects of the moon on the waters, like San Franciscans talking about The Big One---edgy, joking, and nervous. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">The osteria was delightful. But the social occasion of the week was my friend&rsquo;s close Venetians friends' invitation to a party for their Irish visitors to the Biennale.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">Who were our hosts, these Venetians</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">?&nbsp; Artists, expats, former Bohemians many years resident in Venice, now landed gentry with children, land, palazzos.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">The evening was an almost exclusively Irish night.&nbsp; No new Venetians need apply. And it was almost overwhelmingly stimulating. The themes of our evening&rsquo;s conversation, to my ears, tended to be 1) the firm establishment of the evening&rsquo;s pecking order by means of demonstrated economic success and 2) the ability to talk the hind leg off a donkey. .. Come to think of it, the second was a subset of the first. The talk was entertaining, often deadly.&nbsp; A documentary that evening about a plague of bees at our host's country estate provided a handy metaphor for the evening.&nbsp; watch out for sticky dangerous swarming stinging stuff! &nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">Robert our host was English, reserved, an eminent painter. In fact, a redoubtable woman academician, whose portrait he had painted, paid us a surprise visit that evening. &nbsp;We all had to shift our places at the dining table to accommodate her and her husband. Some of us ended up clutching oily, sandy cold plates of clams on our laps far far away from the table, in Siberia. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">Alison, Robert&rsquo;s wife, an American, blonde, attractive, and charming, ran a gallery in Venice. &nbsp;Alison starred in one of the evening&rsquo;s documentaries, featuring the invasion of bees into her &nbsp;Italian country house. The documentary film featured her family and friends as they attempted to cut out the combs from her house, trap the combs and the honey, and help lead the bees to a new locale. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">And then there was my friend G., half Greek, half Italian, speaking six languages. Always accompanied by her little dog; enrobed in many layers of sweaters like an English country </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">woman; chain-smoker.&nbsp; Whom I would always remember as valiantly battling a huge Nagasaki turkey. My kind host who had made the whole trip possible. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">The guests were Irish folk</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;""> in town for the Biennale&mdash;architects, writers, documentary film makers.&nbsp; Highly articulate, funny, fond of slipping subtle insults into the chat. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">These Irish were fluent, dramatic, ardent filibusterers. &nbsp;These guys (and one very pleasant muted woman architect) may possibly have reserved some special zingers- for me&mdash;I had after all been billed as a female &ldquo;journalist&rdquo; by my helpful friend and hostess. Red rag to these bulls. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">I did have one point in my favor-- the fact that I was Irish on my father&rsquo;s side, no matter how many generations removed from the auld sod. &nbsp;I did not tell them my mother was British. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">I met three Irishmen in rapid succession- two filmmakers and one writer.&nbsp; It was as though they had been lined up for my perusal. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">The leader of the group was documentary filmmaker Dylan. Dylan&rsquo;s opening lines to me about his own girlfriend certainly grabbed the attention.&nbsp; He leered, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s like a bloke as a friend, but she cleans up nice, doesn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">There were some interesting tensions. After a two week holiday in Japan with girlfriend Dylan was now a self-proclaimed expert&mdash;on the country and on its women.&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite the fact that there were two women in the audience who had actually lived in Japan and might correct him, &nbsp;Dylan explained to his audience that any contemporary Japanese woman could be described as one of three G&rsquo;s- Gucci, Geisha, or Goth.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">However, Dylan&rsquo;s Japanese documentary was beautiful. &nbsp;The ryokans (country inns), brilliant autumn leaves; the temples and shrine festivals- it was deeply nostalgic. The man was gifted, no matter how difficult it was to acknowledge it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had tears in my eyes.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">Dylan&rsquo;s next Italian documentary was about a plague of bees, at our host&rsquo;s country Italian estates.&nbsp; Images&mdash;the large dripping combs of honey; the swarms of bees circling menacingly and stinging our hostess vigorously. We saw the dead bees; we saw the blood where they had stung our hostess. &nbsp;Finally, the giant combs of honey were drained and stored. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">The second Irishman I met was even more intent than our hosts on displaying his holdings.&nbsp; He carried photos not of family but of his stately home, his land, and his pigs (he had advised his wife to keep pigs to occupy her mind&hellip; (they are intelligent creatures).&nbsp; Well. I had no pigs and no land. . So I kept mum.</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">We did establish one thing in common. I learned that my favorite Venice Biennale architecture show had generally been acknowledged as among the Biennale&rsquo;s best: &ldquo;<em>Motet for 40 Voices</em>&rdquo;, based on the Renaissance choral music <em>Spem in alium nunquam habui </em>by Thomas Tallis.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">I commented that technically it was stunning. Every voice, miked alone, stood on its own speaker and pillar in a huge semi circle. One could listen to this voice, or stand in the middle and hear all forty voices at once.&nbsp; I said, it must have been quite a trick to get the mikes positioned exactly so that the ambient noise would not interfere.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">My respondent was affronted.. This was <em>his </em>m&eacute;tier, not mine. Or did I call myself a documentary film producer? &nbsp;&nbsp;I said, mildly, I sing.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t mollify him. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">After a discussion about Obama (I liked him,&nbsp; he didn&rsquo;t) and about Sarah Palin, whom he purported to love,&nbsp; and I didn&rsquo;t, he abruptly went silent, &nbsp;then turned on his heel to &nbsp;go for a smoke. . </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">The third man, named &ldquo;The Little Monk&rdquo; in Gaelic, a Gaelic linguist and historian, was grimly determined to describe his holdings, <em>and</em> his books. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his urgent questions as to what I was working on I replied, mendaciously, the Biennale. He became agitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much of the Biennale are you covering?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s your editor?&rdquo; &ldquo;What is your page count?&rdquo; I had apparently gotten right under his skin. As he continued to squeeze me for information, the party broke up. . </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">Well.&nbsp; It had been almost too stimulating. I learned I too could emulate these Irishmen and women- orate, opine, slip the deadly shiv into my speech, and generally hold my own.&nbsp; But I would be happy to let a decent interval go by before another such opportunity. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: normal;""><strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">Coda:</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">&nbsp; At the end of my week in Venice, we decided to go out for dinner. .The food was delicious (pasta with arugula) and I&rsquo;d had my first taste of Prosecco.

<p><span style=""font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS','sans-serif'; color: black;"">My friend&rsquo;s little dog took charge of saying good-bye.&nbsp; She ran round and round barking madly.

The wall in the clouds,"","<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I simply love the take-off. The plane stops at the beginning of the flight strip, I imagine instantly the multitude of buttons of different colours in the pilot's cabin, which makes you think of a Star Trek episode (I saw only 2 of them in my life and only by accident), only this ones you really have to know well.<br /><br />The sudden high speed sticks you to your seat and then you start asking yourself when?...now?...now?...now? I never guessed. We always took off at the moment when I started to focus more on the speed, or sound, or the natural peacefullness of the passanger next to me, in this case a cheerful german.<br /><br />I start smiling. Have no idea why. I like the sensation, I have to admit, but I do aknowledge that this is not the reason. Maybe I got contaminated from my neighbour, or (I'm tempted to lie to myself), he did from me.<br /><br />We estrange rapidly and apparently surely from the ground. My neighbour is picking his nose, making small balls and throwing them on the floor, between me and him, like he intends to build a german wall between us from his apparently very distubring snots, since the spacial proximity of my flowerish shoes and (let me take a look) his mountain boots was not taken into consideration.<br /><br />Anyway, the man reads...so I have forgiven him, my shoes never. I stare discreetly. He is reading ""Voodoo History"", my shoes become exponencially more interested.<br /><br />Let's get back to the take-off. I never succeed at identifying my house, building, district, car, streets (which name I never remember, because I am just not interested). The houses become tiny, that's the moment when I realize why are the sky people so frightening - because they can see our smallness.<br /><br />We reach the clouds. My german neighbour sleeps with his book in his hand, his cleaned nose is tempted second by second to invade the space of the historical art of voodoo. I ask myself, how come the book didn't fall yet? Maybe it's beceause of the coulds, they make it float.<br /><br />We pass the clouds. The sun is appearing, enlightening exactly my window. I take it as a divine sign, ""I'm a special person"" I think and start smiling again. This time for a known reason. I am hot. My palms start to sweat, I wipe them off, not at all discreetly, over my balck pants...I guess we passed the discreet line at the foundation of the german wall.<br /><br />You won't believe this, he woke up! He starts reading again. Mostly trying than succeeding. A sort of a preparation for a really heavy sleep. I bet he will fall, hopefully, on the book and not on my shoulder which still hurts from my monster backpack.<br /><br />I detected a polar bear in one cloud. I bet he's happy. He is.<br /><br />I dropped my book on the floor. Big mistake. My neighbour germanish manner smiled at me...oh, well, so the wall didn't reach the mouth level, yet.<br /><br />I don't have a watch and on the plane I am not capable of aproximating time...I guess you could say that I spend my entire life in a plane if you knew me.<br /><br />The clouds remind me of snow, the snow reminds me of cold, I better not look at them. Anyway they are too many to be counted up.<br /><br />I'm hungry, I could eat anything, anything for free. I never understood why are the prices so high in the plane, to give you the impression that the food tastes better or because they want to prive you from your principles? I'm taking it too far, I'm sure the explanation is simple and stupid, but i can only reach it through complicated eliminations.<br /><br />How much time is left? Should I ask my neighbour? I don't think so, I'm too afraid to wake him up from reading. I look fugitively around, too many people that are going bald on this plane. If we would crash successfully, we would die suffocated by hair or snots. I would pick the snots, I use to eat them as a child. Many do. Yet, the sensation of the hair in your mouth...I'm sure the chinese used it as a torture and many betrayed their countries from it.<br /><br />The stewardess has incredibly white teeth, a mouth like that can convince you of anything.<br /><br />My neighbour woke up and is insisting on building the wall. If we crash successfully, I'm never getting out of here.<br /><br />It's an extremely dense fog outside (how strange ""outside"" sounds in here, it's always an approximated one). It's like we're in the water. How would a flying submarine look like, or a plane diving? The submarine sounds more plausible, but boring. Maybe if there would really be one, it would be fascinating.<br /><br />I wonder: how peaceful plane constructors sleep at night? In my opinnion these are the only people that can't allow themselves to be lazy at work. They have to check a lot (I tried to find a number, but 10 is too small and one thousand is too big, I got lost in between, so I stick at ""a lot"") of times to make sure everything is perfect. Here perfection must exist. I bet it's really hard to be a wife of a plane constructor.<br /><br />The sky is superb. Clouds of different shapes and sizes, at different hights, through a blue that makes you believe that you finally discovered the true blue colour. Throught the holes in upper clouds I see the inferior layer of clouds, which move to the opposite direction of the superior layer or the same direction as the plane; I wish there would be a supernatural explanation to it or some complicated physics explanation, but I presume it's just an optical illusion. I shouldn't look at them. Illusions don't last long and I don't want to be dissappointed. The imposibility of counting is enough for now.<br /><br />I don't want clouds anymore, I want food and an extra leg room, but both of them cost ten times more here, in the clouds. The constructor of the wall, my neighbour, is smiling. What did he do in Romania, I wonder. Doesn't matter, I want to believe he's happy and he loves his wife (he has a wedding ring) and she loves him and I hope they don't have the same habbits.<br /><br />The pilot is annoucing that we're about to land. In a beaten black and blue English he gives us some local ground information and wishes us a ""Happy Christmas!"". He sounds bored, I guess he's not very passionate about the landing.<br /><br />I have butterflies in my stomach. My palms are sweaty again and it has nothing to do with landing. It's about the fact that I'm about to kiss...I missed so much the earthly stuff.<br /><br />We're landing. I always guess the ""Now!"".<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;</p>",2011-04-05 07:00:00 UTC

<p>A Survival Guide to Rio<br />for Gringos</p>
<p>Safety of your passport is the primary concern for you during the trip. It is the most important thing and the thing that you absolutely may not fuck up under any circumstance. Take good care of your password, because without it you are likely to face hell.</p>
<p>The biggest problem when arriving to another country is the inability to understand the natives. (It is arguable that the biggest problem is not this, but unemployment and/or lack of money to travel but this aspect of the lifestyle won't be covered in this body.)</p>
<p>The survival guide to a nomadic life here is applicable to all countries, all epochs and all varieties of personalities. However the pragmatic part of this will be centered on the culture of Brasil, specifically Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>What is this lifestyle? My lifestyle is not for sale, and I put more effort than just buying it, to obtain it. That is basically what I mean by ""Lifestyle."" It is something that preoccupies you regardless of money, regardless of success---it preoccupies you because you and it are inseparable. It is your lifestyle.</p>
<p>Upon arriving I did not know the language. Generally speaking, if you have the money there are only four things that you must absolutely be able to communicate; the minimal set of survival items.</p>
<ol>
<li>You have to be able to ask for, and understand directions.</li>
<li>You have to be able to book into a hostel.</li>
<li>You have to be able to order food.</li>
<li>You have to be able to get a beer.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you go to Rio knowing only how to say this, you will actually be alright. Your experience may suck, but at least you will not disappear. As you can see, these things are very few and you can probably learn them in a week. It is beneficial also to spend some time understanding and memorizing grammar + vocabulary, however it so happens that learning a language is significantly easier when you are submerged in it, than when you are outside of it. So, do not spend too much time or worry over learning another language while in the States, unless of course you study language and it is a part of your lifestyle.</p>",2010-12-04 08:00:00 UTC
